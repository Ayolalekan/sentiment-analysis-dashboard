"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age.

"It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job.",5,positive,great tablet price dont expect fast expensive one meant casual use great job price cant beat get nice large microsd card dont worry space run little slow certain thing multitasking simple tablet ive run plenty p video without fail great ebooks file elaborate pdfs take load lol graphic battery life seems good small table toothe real issue amazon app store limited offshoot android apps available way around wish would allow access google play least offer appsso nice inexpensive table work great money love dont get upset doesnt run fast tablet thats job,"['price', 'battery']"

Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.,4,positive,great price dollar great tablet fast everything accept game play example play asphalt game barely playable graphic struggle tablet higher graphic game also amazon tablet google play store load google play great tube video put google play amazon tablet screen good long sun isnt hitting stereo speaker sound great loud really liked tablet price really like play game good graphic quality said return tablet ordered nvidia shield inch tablet best buy dollar got shield week ago wow difference graphic gaming quality thing good xbox p nvidia shield tablet simply unbelievable price considering apple samsung tablet fast tablet least twice cost plus dubbles gaming console xbox pc game k tv amazon tablet also great tablet normal usage gamer like nvidia tablet tablet choice hand period dont know bbuy kind hide nvidia tab website doesnt sell store displayed store would outsell apple samsung tablet hope help thanks,"['price', 'quality']"

"I read about this new 8"" Amazon tablet in the New York Times. My Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and I needed to upgrade - for as little money as possible.This Amazon Fire 8"" is an excellent value for the money(only $89!) - very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. I was skeptical of the Silk browser, which I'd never heard of, but it works fine. There is no ""page forward"" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but I can live with that.It has exceeded my expectations and I'm very happy with it.

"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me.

We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice.

It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you.

From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8.

"I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7"" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I'm glad I did.I have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that's not what I purchased the tablets for, so it's a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.

"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed.",3,neutral,kindle purchased black friday sale time felt steal price first tablet purchased year ago original kindle fire following year purchased ipad mini ipad mini may already know ipad explandable memory kindle expanded memory gb good selling point setting new kindle fire noticed viewing photo clear original ipad mini even without retina display color greenishyellowish tint may notice something else compare im pro photographer quite unaceptable expecting perfection color people skin tone appeared greenish vulcan also like read tech manual magazine many pdf format kindle read format kindle fire year still cannot display cover art pdf book etc display acrobat pdf document logo instead large library pdfs read document title instead able select seeing cover book enough ive spoiled ease use ipad display accurate color back store prompt refund went overallstill good deal used ipad reason amyou may disappointed,['price']

These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7"" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets.

"Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road.",4,positive,purchased child tablet couldnt happier buying thinking would cutrate ok small child play long car ride rainy day despite low cost unimpressive stats surprised quality screen perfectly adequate game kid show parental controlschild profile setting excellent stereo speaker crush built speaker ipad air drawback found far power related battery seems drain fairly quickly would consider normal use included charger typical usb type take long time fully charge tablet suspect charger limitation rather tablet may charge better different power supplyi wish purchased two tablet price sale would kept second use road,"['price', 'quality', 'battery']"

The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it!

"I've been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a no-brainier to upgrade. The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. After a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. The Oasis' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The addition of the cover is interesting but after a month's use I think it's pretty clear the cover/battery is there only to boost the very short-lived battery in the kindle itself. ""Months"" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. The screen is clear and bright, I can't see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs.",4,positive,ive kindle owner since early day new version come past usually nobrainier upgrade oasis little challenging price really make stop think upgrade worth lot thought factor convinced switch reappearance page turning button missed since vanished kindle keyboard paper white voyage great device often accidentally changed page accidentally pinched bezel carrying device even shifting position couch oasis button removed issue delighted weight thinness device also appreciated tho paper white etc pretty thin already addition cover interesting month use think pretty clear coverbattery boost shortlived battery kindle month battery life seems impossible unless keep screen low illumination read minute day screen clear bright cant see led issue others complained interface seem snappier older version ultimately real justification buying kindle miss page turn button want pay top dollar otherwise existing kindles meet need,"['price', 'battery']"

"As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging.

It's light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful.

"There's no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. Holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. So what are the cons you may ask...For one, the battery life depends on the provided case. It acts like a travel charger in a sense. Why a con? Well, it limits your customization options. And there's no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. So, you best be cautious with it.And two, the price obviously! But if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case...It may almost even out. But a $290-$350 device is hard to justify when it's just for reading.Still would recommend to any fan of e-readers/reading",4,positive,there doubt best kindle device available battery life astonishing design unique extremely ergonomic holding hand pleasurable experience fit like glove con may askfor one battery life depends provided case act like travel charger sense con well limit customization option there way purchase color replacement time best cautious itand two price obviously take account basically given premium case device premium device traveling charge inside caseit may almost even device hard justify readingstill would recommend fan ereadersreading,"['price', 'battery', 'design']"
"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons.

"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website.

"When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis.

"With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two).",5,positive,cover attached battery last good long period cover detached use primarily oasis thin almost weightless hand ability switch hand flip upside mean one never seems tire holding device read book fit pant pocket perfect traveling battery seems last heavy usage least several day tend reconnect cover night assuming help recharge basic oasis battery regardless well worth replacing older kindle reader newer oasis bought two,['battery']
"Even when I’m outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I’m reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn’t heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I’m on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I’m sitting down. No matter what I’m doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won’t allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its “dual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.” This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don’t occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don’t limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I’m done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don’t plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn’t needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren’t a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won’t appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn’t last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it?

"Finally received the Kindle Lighted Leather Cover for the newest version Kindle. It is VERY lightweight and I had to double and triple check the description considering it states this is a leather cover. The front cover is very thin with a medium-weight cardboard feel to it. The leather on the front cover is extremely thin and you can immediately tell the surface will be easily scratched and marred with normal everyday use. The inside of the front cover has a thin microfiber material to protect the screen. The back cover is hollowed out plastic to form-fit your Kindle and snaps in with relative ease.Using the enclosed graphic instruction card, I removed the Kindle as shown, having to use just enough pressure to make me a bit concerned for someone who would place and remove their Kindle in this cover frequently. However, I plan on using this cover as a full-time solution for both protection and as a light source.I went ahead and pulled up a book and switched the light on, heading to a closet to see how this looked in complete darkness. The light pulls out of the back cover and is nice and stiff and has a locked full-out position. The spread of the light is greater on top obviously but it does reach the entire screen on the Kindle. There was no glare or reflection and I was able to easily read the page without any noticeable straining.If I were to choose between this design and the Kindle Keyboard lighted cover, which I have used since its release, I would choose this newer cover.Read more",4,positive,finally received kindle lighted leather cover newest version kindle lightweight double triple check description considering state leather cover front cover thin mediumweight cardboard feel leather front cover extremely thin immediately tell surface easily scratched marred normal everyday use inside front cover thin microfiber material protect screen back cover hollowed plastic formfit kindle snap relative easeusing enclosed graphic instruction card removed kindle shown use enough pressure make bit concerned someone would place remove kindle cover frequently however plan using cover fulltime solution protection light sourcei went ahead pulled book switched light heading closet see looked complete darkness light pull back cover nice stiff locked fullout position spread light greater top obviously reach entire screen kindle glare reflection able easily read page without noticeable strainingif choose design kindle keyboard lighted cover used since release would choose newer coverread,['design']
"I owned a Kindle Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new Kindle. I can't say this experience has as been as positive.Let's start off with what's good about the case. The Kindle battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don't use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my Kindle Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don't plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn't look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more",3,neutral,owned kindle keyboard year purchased leather lighted case unit corner light left little desired far even lighting overall pleased case based experience went ahead purchased lighted cover new kindle cant say experience positivelets start whats good case kindle battery powered light big improvement light centered screen illumination even dont use light often case nice balanced coverage one positive case appreciate much lighter one feel previous generation hinge area smaller mean less spine folding effect one took heavy use never took kindle keyboard case put snug fit seen complaint issue tight though dont plan keep case full time aware may take effort get back situation tight fit exactly want mileage may varynow negative case feel cheap especially change price point previous cover felt like solidly made piece work whereas new cover feel half sturdy thinness case doubt done minimize weight realize personal issue outside thickness though doesnt look feel well made textured surface previous model leather feel much like real book finally stunning oversight lack closure deviceread,"['price', 'battery']"
"I purchased this Kindle case in the Saddle Tan color. The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the Kindle. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the Kindle perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the Kindle itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the Kindle. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the Kindle itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this Kindle case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Amazon!",4,positive,purchased kindle case saddle tan color leather high quality wonderful new smell well beautiful stitching around border front case add bulk kindle find quite comfortable hold one hand two front cover fold behind case truly feel like holding actual book readingat top case plastic arm pull upward reveal light illuminates screen kindle perfectly dark room eye trouble reading light activated light powered kindle way two metal prong inside case making contact two metal tab lower back kindle arm light seem bit delicate could see young child inadvertently breaking care shown fear time first piece stop functioning case regularly usedmy criticism case way secure front cover opening would nice include clasp kind stretchable band keep case closed paid case almost expensive kindle price designer forethought include mean securing case opening aside potential problem kindle case perfect add bit sophistication already awesome devicekudos amazon,"['price', 'quality']"
"I have had the Kindle Keyboard with it's lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover. I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it's cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle's batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle's battery.Read more",4,positive,kindle keyboard lighted cover new kindle lighted cover briefly compare list pro con coverin comparisonthe kindle keyboard cover much heavier new kindle cover new case much better job securing kindle well longer hinged one edge instead form fit inside rigid rubber shell attache back new kindlethe lighting case old case lit screen top right corner new case light screen top middlei feel like old light mechanism durable light bar cover made stiff thin plastic instead thick rubbery plastic contained light old cover also hinge open instead pulling case hinge feel subparthe light new case less angled tends get eye reading old kindle keyboard case didall still like new case fit new kindle well increase size weight much leather somewhat thin horribly look sleek kindle keeping caseproscompact case look sleektight secure fituses kindles battery additional power neededprovides adequate lighting across entire screenconslightbar hinge seems cheapsince received today cannot yet evaluate additional drain case place kindles batteryread,['battery']
"I read every single review for this cover before I decided to buy it, but I am glad that I finally decided to pull the trigger. I have never had a Kindle or another cover, so my review is based on a first-timer's perspective. This is my feedback:1) I agree that this cover is expensive. Ridiculously expensive. But, after pricing other covers and other lights, then factoring in that I would have to buy replacement batteries for any other light, it did not seem like I would be saving much money if I bought something else. Plus, the fact that the light is built-in was very appealing and turns out to be extremely convenient.2) Yes, the cover should have had a magnet or something for closure. That was the main reason for my initial hesitation, not the price. I thought about using a rubber band around it, but some people mentioned that a rubber band would look ugly around the pretty cover (which, by the way, is quite pretty in the wine purple color). I ended up knitting a small little sleeve to slip over my Kindle cover to keep the cover closed, for additional protection, and to prevent scratches, because:3) The cover does scratch quite easily. I agree with one reviewer who did not seem to mind the scratches on the cover, because doesn't that show that the cover is doing its job to protect the Kindle But, it does sound like the same cover for the Kindle Keyboard was much more durable. It would be nice for the cover to keep looking fresh and new, but I would rather my Kindle be protected than for my cover to look perfect. My little knitted sleeve is helping with that, but I know a lot of people wouldn't want to use an additional cover.4) Some people commented that the cover added too much to the size and weight of the Kindle.

"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.",4,positive,ive lot tablet past

I was very leery of getting them 'tablets' because of all the things on the internet. But once I set them up I saw that the Kindle Fire has amazing Parental Controls. I can set the times they can play on them and how long they can use them (even how long on specific things - games, videos, web, etc). Most importantly there is an option that allows them to be on the Web but it's only kid stuff. I also love the fact that I have access to Amazon on any device and can share things from it to both the kids' Fire's. I can also check what they've been doing on them. They can only download things that I share. All these controls made me feel better about buying them and more confident that they are safe. There is something called FreeTime which I believe I have the free version but you can get a cheap subscription and it will give you access to thousands of free books. If you have kids, especially younger ones I would highly suggest the Fire.

"I am pleasantly surprised with Amazon's new 5th Generation Kindle Fire.As a purchaser of a 1st Generation Kindle Fire, I welcomed the addition of a dual camera option plus the expansion of a microSD slot.

After finding the appropriate setting to turn off the promotional ads, my Fire became more enjoyable.

"This Amazon Fire tablet is AMAZING. It's not an ipad or galaxy, but it still packs a ton of value into a nice package. You get a lot of nice features here, and not a lot of bull, as one would often expect from a device so cheap. The screen is surprisingly well made and durable. While it's not the sharpest one out there, it's not exactly blurry either at 1024 x 600 pixels. There is only a single speaker, and no sort of flashlight aside from the screen. The speaker gets to a decent volume, but I would not consider it to be loud. I took a leap of faith here in buying this and I am so very glad that I did because this tablet has far surpassed my expectations in every way. The games are smooth and fast with minimal lag from what I've seen so far. This plays demanding 3d games pretty well I may add. The Amazon store has a lot of cool free things to mess with when you first start out. It only took about a half an hour or so to set up and update everything. The micro sd slot accepts up to 128gb cards. Battery life is ok. If not gaming on this, you can expect 6 hours or more. With light use, this could last all day on a single charge. Video is smooth and the screen is nice and surprisingly bright. The responsiveness of the screen is spot on. I can't really mention any downfall , because there really isn't any. The one thing I will say could be better it the wifi. When set to default settings, wifi kept turning off on me. Once I set wifi up to be always on, it was much better. You usually get what you pay for. In this case, you get more. This unit feels like it could have easily cost well over $100. I'm just sad that I didn't yet get a protective case for mine. I would HIGHLY recommend this product to friends, family, or anyone who needs a nice tablet or wants a nice gift for someone. This Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet earns a solid 10 out of 10 stars from me. I'm picky too. If you are even slightly considering this, just buy it. You won't be disappointed.",5,positive,amazon fire tablet amazing ipad galaxy still pack ton value nice package get lot nice feature lot bull one would often expect device cheap screen surprisingly well made durable sharpest one exactly blurry either x pixel single speaker sort flashlight aside screen speaker get decent volume would consider loud took leap faith buying glad tablet far surpassed expectation every way game smooth fast minimal lag ive seen far play demanding game pretty well may add amazon store lot cool free thing mess first start took half hour set update everything micro sd slot accepts gb card battery life ok gaming expect hour light use could last day single charge video smooth screen nice surprisingly bright responsiveness screen spot cant really mention downfall really isnt one thing say could better wifi set default setting wifi kept turning set wifi always much better usually get pay case get unit feel like could easily cost well im sad didnt yet get protective case mine would highly recommend product friend family anyone need nice tablet want nice gift someone amazon fire inch tablet earns solid star im picky even slightly considering buy wont disappointed,['battery']

So having this Amazon tablet for about a month or so it has its pros & cons let's be clear you aren't getting an iPad with amazing specs but you are getting an entry level tablet great for kids or for regular things like browsing the web & emails. the camera on here isn't really the best you're better off using a potatoe ha it's similar to the camera on the razor from back in the day. Watching videos on here is alright you aren't getting 1080p when I tired watching videos on higher resolution the videos would work correctly I think 720p was a little too much but then again could be my wifi connection but overall it's great for the price really easy to carry around & great for trips to keep any kid busy only thing I really didn't like was the ads on the home screen so for 50 sometimes even lower its a great pick really worth it ! remember it's a 50 dollar tablet compared to a 500-1000 tablet it's not going to be the same but it does get the job down (:,5,positive,amazon tablet month pro con let clear arent getting ipad amazing spec getting entry level tablet great kid regular thing like browsing web email camera isnt really best youre better using potatoe ha similar camera razor back day watching video alright arent getting p tired watching video higher resolution video would work correctly think p little much could wifi connection overall great price really easy carry around great trip keep kid busy thing really didnt like ad home screen sometimes even lower great pick really worth remember dollar tablet compared tablet going get job,['price']

The standard 8 gig will only hold what the machine needs and maxing out the internal memory may make it lock up. I put in a 32 gig card and downloaded several movies and books and it still have a ton more space and runs really fast (no streaming issues).

In that case, it definitely is worth it to spend more for tablet capabilities.I use my amazon fire 7"" tablet for reading, searching the internet, shopping from amazon, and watching movies from my sd card.

"I bought this tablet as a gift for my mother-in-law, who is not very tech-savvy. She already owns a laptop, but was interested in getting a tablet to use while watching TV, rather than a whole laptop. She also travels around quite a bit, so having something light she could take with her was a big plus. I've owned a couple Amazon tablets before, so I had an idea of how they worked, and I wanted something at a low price point, so I decided on this. So far, she loves it! A couple of important points:-The low price point comes at the cost of hardware. After using my Fire HDX, this tablet felt just a little slow, but not excessively so. It performed better in basic tasks (loading apps, web browsing, etc) than I expected based on my experiences with other tablets at similar price points.-As an Amazon tablet, this runs a modified version of Android, but does NOT have baked-in access to Google services (including the Google Play Store). You will be restricted to Amazon-approved apps, unless you sideload apps on your own, or are able to get access to Google services yourself. Popular apps like Netflix, Skype, and Facebook are all present, but the selection pales in comparison to native Android.",5,positive,bought tablet gift motherinlaw techsavvy already owns laptop interested getting tablet use watching tv rather whole laptop also travel around quite bit something light could take big plus ive owned couple amazon tablet idea worked wanted something low price point decided far love couple important pointsthe low price point come cost hardware using fire hdx tablet felt little slow excessively performed better basic task loading apps web browsing etc expected based experience tablet similar price pointsas amazon tablet run modified version android bakedin access google service including google play store restricted amazonapproved apps unless sideload apps able get access google service popular apps like netflix skype facebook present selection pale comparison native android,['price']

Battery life leaves a little to be desired and the tablet can get warm. Cameras are not good at all, but I guess would suffice for video chat.

"The main reason I purchased this was because I like to annotate scriptures and insert personal notes or related notes to passages especially meaningful to me. It's much easier to insert comments now with the keyboard display than it was to insert comments on the old Kindle I have, so that was a huge bonus. The one draw back/gripe I have is the ""back"" triangle button. The scriptures I read have hyperlinks that take me to other scriptures, and before on the old Kindle, I could hit the back button and it would take me back to the previous page I was on. E.g., if I was on page 10, and selected a link to page 14, the back button would take me back to page 10. With this kindle, the back button takes you back to the library, and the previous page tap/swipe takes you back to the previous page, e.g., if I'm on page 10, and I take a link to page 14, it'll take me to page 13. The work-around that I discovered is using the bookmark function which is only slightly more time-intensive than the old Kindle back button. The only other concern I have is the battery life. If I'm going to enjoy some long reading without heavy annotation (e.g., reading fantasy), I'll probably use my old Kindle. If I want to do some serious annotation and cross referencing on different commentaries (e.g., scripture study), the new Kindle is the better bet. The commentaries I reference are PDFs - I could create a Kindle book out of them, but it messes up the tables in the PDFs, and I don't care for the PDF viewer that came with the Kindle because you cannot bookmark the PDF or annotate it. I purchased a very inexpensive PDF app called ""exPDF Reader"" which does everything I want with PDFs. All-in-all, the Kindle - Fire is a great tool and fits into my lunch box, so I take it everywhere. I read that others were concerned about it's weight, but I find it to be light. I'm used to reading door stopper books, and it is definitely more manageable than one of those. A pleasant surprise I had was the ""blue shade"" feature which enables me to read at night without worry of negatively impacting my sleep cycle/quality of sleep. You don't need a separate booklight for this like you do for the old Kindle, so that's a nice perk too.",5,positive,main reason purchased like annotate scripture insert personal note related note passage especially meaningful much easier insert comment keyboard display insert comment old kindle huge bonus one draw backgripe back triangle button scripture read hyperlink take scripture old kindle could hit back button would take back previous page eg page selected link page back button would take back page kindle back button take back library previous page tapswipe take back previous page eg im page take link page itll take page workaround discovered using bookmark function slightly timeintensive old kindle back button concern battery life im going enjoy long reading without heavy annotation eg reading fantasy ill probably use old kindle want serious annotation cross referencing different commentary eg scripture study new kindle better bet commentary reference pdfs could create kindle book mess table pdfs dont care pdf viewer came kindle cannot bookmark pdf annotate purchased inexpensive pdf app called expdf reader everything want pdfs allinall kindle fire great tool fit lunch box take everywhere read others concerned weight find light im used reading door stopper book definitely manageable one pleasant surprise blue shade feature enables read night without worry negatively impacting sleep cyclequality sleep dont need separate booklight like old kindle thats nice perk,['battery']

"I bought this expecting the same quality i have received in the previous 3 kindles I purchased. I am disappointed. I like the price. The home screen is just all the apps right in your face, not just the ones you want, like in the older version kindle fire. I mostly use it for reading books, and so far I'm dissatisfied. It's great to swipe to the next page, but when I want to go to settings or something else while reading I find it difficult to open. Instead the page just turns and by the time I finally get to the book settings, I've lost my spot! I downloaded the Facebook app and it's very slow. Maybe it's Amazons way of telling me that's what I get for $50 but come on. Sometimes I like to use the kindle to search the web and that too is slow. I compared it to my older version and there is a noticible difference in speed. I know there are other cool user tools, but for me I mostly use it to read and check Facebook and maybe Pinterest. It's priced well if you want it for kids, it's user friendly and my kids have already figured out all the options. I would recommend it for kids or for people who are technologically not savvy.",3,neutral,bought expecting quality received previous kindles purchased disappointed like price home screen apps right face one want like older version kindle fire mostly use reading book far im dissatisfied great swipe next page want go setting something else reading find difficult open instead page turn time finally get book setting ive lost spot downloaded facebook app slow maybe amazon way telling thats get come sometimes like use kindle search web slow compared older version noticible difference speed know cool user tool mostly use read check facebook maybe pinterest priced well want kid user friendly kid already figured option would recommend kid people technologically savvy,"['price', 'quality']"
"et me start by saying, please do not buy this tablet expecting it to be comparable to an Ipad or Samsung tablet. I think the people who expect that are the ones who are disappointed by its features.I personally love this tablet. I wanted a tablet so that I could read, check emails, watch shows ( Hulu, Netflix, AMC), shop online and do some web surfing. I am a pretty simple gal. I did not expect much when purchasing this tablet. I assumed the picture quality would be fairly poor, that it would load pretty slowly, and that I would be unable to download most of the apps I wanted. It wouldn't have bothered me, being that I believe you get what you pay for ( and I could not afford an Ipad or Samsung at the moment). Boy was I proven wrong.I was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality from the moment I turned it on. I have had other tablets ( and paid about the same) with terrible picture quality. I actually love watching my shows on this tablet because it is as if I am watching them on my television.This tablet loads pretty darn quickly. I have never had an issue with it loading slowly or getting stuck.I have been able to download EVERY app that I wanted, except Instagram ( oh well, no biggie). And me being the Amazon freak that I am, I was happy to see Amazon apps pre-loaded onto the tablet ( shopping, music etc. ). Speaking of music, the sound quality is pretty great too!I am very very happy with this purchase, it really is a steal.

"My view comes from being only a IPad user. And my purchase purpose was for a very young granddaughter whose sole purpose right now is to steal my Ipad to watch YouTube cartoons, and she operates it very well.I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm returning this in less than 24 hours. So I didn't give this much of a chance. First it seems it REALLY wants you to sign up for Amazon Free Time ($4.99 month). Guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if I did that.So created the child profile on the tablet, moved the YouTube app to the profile. Opened the app and got selections for Popular, Music, Movies etc... Could not locate a ""search"" feature. After repeated tapping, got Music to open. Only to get a warning that ""this content is restricted in the Amazon Free Time app"". What? So I have to join to unlock YouTube? I'm technically savy so the fact that I was frustrated didn't bear well for the granddaughter. Maybe there was another way around this but I didn't look. Should not have to.Couple this with the random ads for games, Amazon Prime, etc that pops up and that was enough for me. So going back to get a Windows tablet where you click on the YouTube app you get what you are expecting without restrictions. For the $49.99 price I had to try this.

"I brought a bargain tablet about a year ago and ended up very disappointed in the browsing speed. I basically wanted a tablet for quick web searches without having to boot my PC. I was nervous to try again, but am SO glad I did. The Amazon Fire $50 tablet is AWESOME for quick surfing tasks. I also use the Kindle e-reader app on it, and this works well too. The reason for my 4-star rating (instead of 5) is two-fold, but both are related to apps. My first issue is the Yahoo email app - for some reason I don't have access to my contacts in it! I didn't realize this at first when I was just reading emails, but trying to send an email was awful... it took about a half hour because I had to dig through my inbox for emails from the people I wanted to send to so I could find their address to put in the TO box of the new message I was creating. What a pain! The other issue is that the app world is dominated by ""for iPhone"" and ""for Android"", so you may be severely limited in what you can find for this tablet because it doesn't fit neatly into one of those two categories. However these are minor annoyances and not the primary reason why I wanted a tablet. So if you need to do quick Internet searches/research or want to use the eReader, then you cannot beat this price for the quality you receive.

"Bought this at Best Buy since I had a $10 reward coupon so only sent $40 for this tablet. Short story this tablet can do everything your smart phone can do and I kinda like Amazon's new OS running on this tablet better than Android, nice clean interface and very user friendly also like the way categories are on top and you can swipe right to view them. As far as speed is concern this tablet is good, you can jump from apps with ease (although installing new apps are a bit slower than on Android) the apps have installed are Facebook,Linkedin, Overdrive, CNN, Pandora, Pinterest, Skpe all run fine. You can even run games on this $50 device, games like Sky Force, Real Racing 3 (these game have high graphics) run surprisingly smooth. Videos on Netflix, HBO Now, Pluto Tv and Youtube look great even though they are not HD. Sound is just ok (my smartphone sounds better) and the display is good compared to other cheap tablets on the market that are not IPS. Battery life is good too, can go a couple of days without charging with just reading books, checking Facebook, surf the web and gaming. Already accidentally dropped my tablet on the floor with no damage at all.I not a Prime Member but purchase a lot from Amazon so this device is convenient when ordering books and other items. This tablet has been rock solid for the week I have it and it's still shocking to me regarding the price with no compromise in quality. Was going to buy the Amazon Fire HD but since my last $270 Amazon tablet was lost this makes more sense since it's at a price point where you can easily replace it. Amazon has really changed the game with this tablet, other's reviews that state that this is only for kids or beginner tablet owner's I disagree with.

"Apples & oranges. They're both fruit, both tasty, but they are different at the same time.When thinking about the new $50 7"" Fire tablet, keep in mind that this is not a high-end Samsung or iPad Mini. It does a lot of the same things, but it's different. It costs a fraction of the cost. With that perspective in mind, this is a fantastic value. In fact, short of finding a nice, 2nd-tier Asus , LG, or Lenovo tablet being pushed on discount sites, probably as refurbs, you're not going to find anything that comes close in value to this new Fire tablet.Prior to getting it, I had my concerns, particularly with the screen given the lower resolution. I have a dozen tablets, and have tried about a dozen others, and screen quality is not something you want to scrimp too much on. Amazon got this right. It is not as crisp as my older Kindle Fire HD 7"" or my Galaxy Note 8.0 or my iPad Mini, but for casual reading, gaming, video viewing, email, etc., the screen is just fine. Worlds beyond most low-end/budget tablets I've tried (especially anything costing under $100 new). My daughter, who has been using a Kindle Fire HD 7"", has not cared one bit about the slightly lower screen resolution.The new Fire OS operating system looks & feels much more like Android or iOS, which is nice overall. It still is not perfect, but overall I think it makes for a much better user experience than the version on older Kindle Fire tablets.The 8GB of internal storage is, of course, paltry, but with the very welcome addition of a microSD slot, carrying loads of media with you for offline consumption is not an issue. What remains to be seen is how performance is impacted if/when the little bit of available internal storage gets filled with apps and other content. So far, this has not been a problem.The inclusion of both front- and rear-facing cameras is a nice bonus. No, you're not going to capture great shots. But both cameras are usable and add value.The speakers are OK. Volume and quality is not great, but is acceptable for general use - and, of course, you can also use headphones or an external speaker to kick things up a notch (or several notches).If you have $150 or more to spend on a tablet, and plan on using it quite a bit, then you can definitely find something a bit nicer. If you're getting this for just occasional use, or for a kid, and are not accustomed to using a high-end tablet, then this is a fantastic buy. I've tested over 20 tablets and for a sub-$100 tablet, this is absolutely a great value. At its current price of $50, it's a no-brainer. Kudos to Amazon for raising the bar on budget tablets AND making quality tablets available to the masses.",5,positive,apple orange theyre fruit tasty different timewhen thinking new fire tablet keep mind highend samsung ipad mini lot thing different cost fraction cost perspective mind fantastic value fact short finding nice ndtier asus lg lenovo tablet pushed discount site probably refurbs youre going find anything come close value new fire tabletprior getting concern particularly screen given lower resolution dozen tablet tried dozen others screen quality something want scrimp much amazon got right crisp older kindle fire hd galaxy note ipad mini casual reading gaming video viewing email etc screen fine world beyond lowendbudget tablet ive tried especially anything costing new daughter using kindle fire hd cared one bit slightly lower screen resolutionthe new fire o operating system look feel much like android io nice overall still perfect overall think make much better user experience version older kindle fire tabletsthe gb internal storage course paltry welcome addition microsd slot carrying load medium offline consumption issue remains seen performance impacted ifwhen little bit available internal storage get filled apps content far problemthe inclusion front rearfacing camera nice bonus youre going capture great shot camera usable add valuethe speaker ok volume quality great acceptable general use course also use headphone external speaker kick thing notch several notchesif spend tablet plan using quite bit definitely find something bit nicer youre getting occasional use kid accustomed using highend tablet fantastic buy ive tested tablet sub tablet absolutely great value current price nobrainer kudos amazon raising bar budget tablet making quality tablet available mass,"['price', 'quality', 'performance']"
"Best bang for the buck! Although it may lack the processing power of the Ipad Mini, it has all the features and is 20% of the cost at $50.00. The battery lasts at least 5 hours of intense gameplay and video watching. I bought this primarily for my wife as a home entertainment device to replace her cell phone to watch video and check email, etc. She was not android savvy, but picked this up in a few days. I was very pleased to find it had Bluetooth! The built in speaker is what you would expect, small, mono and tinny. Although it isn't listed HD, at 7 inches an SD picture is razor sharp.

I can get up to 7-8 hours depending on the task at hand.

"The new Amazon Fire tablet is surprisingly good, especially for the price. The performance is good, the size is good, and the weight is good. The biggest new feature is the expandable memory slot, which is something new for this generation of Fires.There are a few downside issues, however. First, the screen has splotchy illumination from the edge lighting. There are numerous light/hot spots around the edge, especially at the bottom where the menu bar is. After a while you get used to it, but compared to other higher priced tablets it's annoying.The software library is the second biggest issue. Amazon has done a decent job in adding new software, but it's app store is nowhere near as robust as the Google and Apple stores.The last issue I have is the 90 day warranty, but that is how they keep the cost down.Amazon developed the Fire tablet to sell other Amazon products, and this tablet seems to have hit a proper balance between that and usability. Web browsing is much better than my first Kindle Fire, and I think better than browsing on an iPad. The app that surprised me the most is the e-mail client, and how easy it is to use. In my opinion, it's a LOT better than the native e-mail client on the iPad, or a Windows tablet.If the build quality as good as a iPad or Samsung tablet? No, not even close, but for $50 it's pretty good device if you don't mind dots of light around the edge.",4,positive,new amazon fire tablet surprisingly good especially price performance good size good weight good biggest new feature expandable memory slot something new generation firesthere downside issue however first screen splotchy illumination edge lighting numerous lighthot spot around edge especially bottom menu bar get used compared higher priced tablet annoyingthe software library second biggest issue amazon done decent job adding new software app store nowhere near robust google apple storesthe last issue day warranty keep cost downamazon developed fire tablet sell amazon product tablet seems hit proper balance usability web browsing much better first kindle fire think better browsing ipad app surprised email client easy use opinion lot better native email client ipad window tabletif build quality good ipad samsung tablet even close pretty good device dont mind dot light around edge,"['price', 'quality', 'performance']"

"For $50 I couldn't ask for more! Aside from access to a ridiculous amount of books, I can listen to music, download apps, play games, watch videos, take photos/ record videos (front & rear facing camera), check emails, and surf the web. Although you have to pay for most book/video purchases Amazon also offers Amazon Prime for a month free ($9.99 after) which makes some purchases less expensive. You can also tack on Kindle Unlimited (free 1st month, also $9.99 a month after) to download up to 10 Kindle Unlimited books at a time. As for the possible cons, the lock screen is set as a rotation of sponsored ads (which is why this tablet is so cheap!). If this bothers you, you can remove the ads for $15 on Amazon. The screen/camera resolution and speaker output isn't anything to write home about but it is absolutely great for the price! The glare while using the tablet can also be bothersome, but I purchased an anti-glare screen protector to resolve that issue.

"I bought a first generation Kindle Fire a few years back, when it was on sale for something like 185.00 and loved it. It took a bit of a beating and I had recently begun to think about buying a replacement. I think that original tablet would probably be more comparable to the Fire HD 10 or something. So my experience with this version is colored by the higher quality first generation model. I also use a Surface Pro tablet as my personal/work computer, so that too probably color my opinion. Out of the box this is lighter than the original. Upon powering up, the original bookshelf carousel is now replaced by a more standard tablet home screen. In terms of processing speed this version feels a little slow. Games I had on the original seem to struggle a bit on the new Fire. Web-browsing is not terrible but is not terribly fast either.

Today my son was home sick, so I had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so I called Amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps THREE times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only $49.99........ Ok. After I calmly explained to he that that was full price and I wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me $10 off my next purchase.Moral of the story, know before you buy & if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo I guess.Also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect (since it wasn't on the box) I found the Amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports.

"This is not as cheap feeling as I thought it was going to be. It's definitely not in the iPad class but it's not bad for what it is. I ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived. Pros: The screen is decent, sound is loud enough for me, no lag scrolling and Real Racing 3 plays smoothly. Cons: The major down side is battery charging time, battery life and built in storage space. When it arrived, it was showing 76% remaining. After less than 2.5 hours use, it had to be charged. I just read where it can take 6 hours or longer to charge. My iPad Air 2 can fully charge in a few hours from 0%. Built in storage is not enough. Yes you can get micro SD cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage. Also, you can not delete Amazon apps without voiding the warranty. And unless I'm missing something, you can't move them either.So if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing, email, watching movies, reading books and the occasional game, this should be just fine...keeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage. But you won't be doing any serious work on this like you can on the iPad's. But to be fair, this is 1/10 the price of my iPad Air 2 and 1/8 the cost of an iPad Mini 4. But I don't believe it's meant to be a direct iPad competitor. Because if it were, it would fail miserably.",3,neutral,cheap feeling thought going definitely ipad class bad ordered online one hand mine arrived pro screen decent sound loud enough lag scrolling real racing play smoothly con major side battery charging time battery life built storage space arrived showing remaining less hour use charged read take hour longer charge ipad air fully charge hour built storage enough yes get micro sd card however apps install built storage also delete amazon apps without voiding warranty unless im missing something cant move eitherso looking something use casually web surfing email watching movie reading book occasional game finekeeping mind battery life lack built storage wont serious work like ipads fair price ipad air cost ipad mini dont believe meant direct ipad competitor would fail miserably,"['price', 'battery']"

"I have owned Kindle's for many years and have always been very happy with their portability, performance and ease of use. The highly expandable memory is what lead me to purchase this Kindle for my son. There are only two areas that I am very disappointed: the first, in the parental control settings, in order to ensure that my son cannot make endless one-touch purchases (and I mean one-easy little touch) I must set the controls either off or on. The problem with this is that he then has no internet access, or extremely limited access, so limited that he cannot access content I normally allow him to access...big problem. Now Amazon is pretty good about refunding unintended app purchases, there is a cancel button, but then you must wait days or more for the refund to be credited. This is an issue that I am getting more frustrated with as we move through time with this purchase. The second issue, Amazon's Kindle app store is weak. If you can find some of the apps that you are searching for they may not be entirely supported by the device, such as Facebook....a major app and a major downfall to Kindle use. Because of this last issue both my son and I have Apple devices to supplement what we cannot do on our Kindle.

"I decided I wanted to ""try"" a tablet for reading books and a little social media instead of using my phone all the time.

I finally got on Amazon's chat feature, and several hours later, including several power cycles and a complete factory restore, the performance is the same. The reps at Amazon tried their best - and FWIW, I knew there was nothing they could do to speed it up before I contacted them, but I thought I would give it a try.

"So, I won't be able to go into super depth for this. I only needed a device to run one app. For my purposes, it literally has one job.I can say, for the price, it's far more responsive that I would have ever guessed. And the screen clarity is great. Good battery life.I was disappointed that the lock screen would always show ads. I don't have the package, and I don't recall it being forward with this fact.

"We purchased this tablet for my daughter for Christmas. She is in kindergarten, and her school allows them to take a device in to use in class. For $39 I couldn't beat that. Especially since i'm not going to send a 5 year old to school with an iPad!This tablet uses FireOS, which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically when I look at an android tablet, major deviations from vanilla Android will make me deduct ratings. The parental controls override any rating deduction in my mind. This tablet has the best parental controls I have ever seen! In addition, the alterations to the home screen make navigation pretty easy for my daughter. All in all this is a win win!The thing that has really impressed me has been the speed and responsiveness. Don't get me wrong, this is not a premium or flagship tablet by any means. With that being said, I have used Android tablets in this price range, and they are garbage! My wife has an insignia tablet that cost $70. It has a higher res screen and a few more features, but it nowhere near as responsive. When it dies it will probably be replaced by an Amazon Fire tablet!Keep in mind, Amazon is trying to hook you into their ecosystem. There are separate home screens for various types of content that Amazon delivers. Your books on one screen, or you can swipe to music on another, etc. From what I see there is no way to have more than one screen of apps. The nice thing about the Amazon ecosystem is that it is cross platform. They maintain apps for Android, iOS, Roku, Windows, MacOS, and so on. Also, their app store is not as extensive as the Google Play Store, so I may end up doing some side loading. That isn't hard, and instructional guides are available online for you.So in conclusion, this is a nice entry level tablet. I would bump up to the Fire HD8 for the extra features if buying for myself. However if buying for younger children or if you're really tight on cash you can't beat it! My twin boys are about to turn 3, and these might be on their list for birthday time!",5,positive,purchased tablet daughter christmas kindergarten school allows take device use class couldnt beat especially since im going send year old school ipadthis tablet us fireos amazon customized version android typically look android tablet major deviation vanilla android make deduct rating parental control override rating deduction mind tablet best parental control ever seen addition alteration home screen make navigation pretty easy daughter win winthe thing really impressed speed responsiveness dont get wrong premium flagship tablet mean said used android tablet price range garbage wife insignia tablet cost higher re screen feature nowhere near responsive dy probably replaced amazon fire tabletkeep mind amazon trying hook ecosystem separate home screen various type content amazon delivers book one screen swipe music another etc see way one screen apps nice thing amazon ecosystem cross platform maintain apps android io roku window macos also app store extensive google play store may end side loading isnt hard instructional guide available online youso conclusion nice entry level tablet would bump fire hd extra feature buying however buying younger child youre really tight cash cant beat twin boy turn might list birthday time,['price']

It's a decent quality tablet for the money. One complaint is the speakers are weak. Have to cup my hand around the speaker side to get some good feedback. The Silk Browser seems to have issues with search engines. Just switching the search engine fixes it though.I got this for when the power goes out at my house. It's served to let me watch netflix. With a bluetooth keyboard it seems adequate for messaging and writing out notes.Video quality is good enough. Though that has more to do with not being super picky about it. I'm considering gifting my dad one of these this year. He commented that the quality looked good. Another complaint would be the amazon app store is limited. No Clash Royale. Which is the only mobile game I actually enjoy. I'm sure there's a way around this. But I'm really not interested in digging around for it. So for the most part it's a good solid low end tablet.,3,neutral,decent quality tablet money one complaint speaker weak cup hand around speaker side get good feedback silk browser seems issue search engine switching search engine fix thoughi got power go house served let watch netflix bluetooth keyboard seems adequate messaging writing notesvideo quality good enough though super picky im considering gifting dad one year commented quality looked good another complaint would amazon app store limited clash royale mobile game actually enjoy im sure there way around im really interested digging around part good solid low end tablet,['quality']

This is a handy feature for me since I travel for work, and spend a good deal of time on planes. Cons: The only drawback I've found is the Web browser.

"I was pleasantly surprised that I have enjoyed the Kindle Fire. This was my first ever use of buying books on Kindle due to summer courses I was taking at the time in May/June 2016. WHAT I LIKED- Kindle Books Synched on MacBook and Fire tablet: very helpful when it came time to write my papers. The highlights I made while I read the book on the tablet synched to the version I read on the MacBook desktop. This helped a ton, especially with things like formatting the footnotes.- Watching Videos: cool little feature while you watch a video you can tap the screen and it will list the actors who are currently one the screen. - Amazon Shopping: I can now understand people's Amazon shopping addictions.l I will give it to Amazon, this tablet became my gateway to using Prime and countless hours of online browsing. Prior to this I rarely purchase items online, I can see how they have made it so easy across platforms. - Portability: I like that I will bring this with me for my general online browsing and reading needs rather than having to use my laptop or my phone. WHAT I DID NOT LIKE- Sign-on Screen Ads:There is no way to turn them off. I suppose for $39/49 depending if you purchased on a sale, the advertisers are subsidizing the cost of the tablet. However, I wished this was stated as a ""feature"" before purchasing it, I may have paid the money and upgraded to the next Kindle if I had known it could not be turned off. - Turning Off/Standby Mode: This took some time to get used to rather than an issue. When you turn the tablet off, it is really on a standby mode so the batteries will drain. You have to hold the button a little longer and make sure it is turned OFF. - Weather App: I don't know if this is just my tablet, the weather app does not update as soon as you open it. It takes minutes if at all to update with the current weather. I have not been able to find in any forums if other people are experiencing the same issue. I have instead downloaded and used other weather apps. But at this point the app is worthless. - Screen Resolution: It's not the best, but I got used to it. For reading and occasional video viewing purposes it is sufficient. - Screen Dimmer/Blue Light Mode: I read and use the tablet at night, and have gotten sensitive to the brightness of the tablet screen. And the system's default dimmer and Blue Light feature is awful. The Blue light app allows you to set the color tone however, it is so orange it makes it unreadable. The app I use instead is called Bluelight Blocking. And even dimming the brightness with the slider was still too bright for me. So I have had to download the app Dimly so be able to set the brightness.",4,positive,pleasantly surprised enjoyed kindle fire first ever use buying book kindle due summer course taking time mayjune liked kindle book synched macbook fire tablet helpful came time write paper highlight made read book tablet synched version read macbook desktop helped ton especially thing like formatting footnote watching video cool little feature watch video tap screen list actor currently one screen amazon shopping understand people amazon shopping addictionsl give amazon tablet became gateway using prime countless hour online browsing prior rarely purchase item online see made easy across platform portability like bring general online browsing reading need rather use laptop phone like signon screen adsthere way turn suppose depending purchased sale advertiser subsidizing cost tablet however wished stated feature purchasing may paid money upgraded next kindle known could turned turning offstandby mode took time get used rather issue turn tablet really standby mode battery drain hold button little longer make sure turned weather app dont know tablet weather app update soon open take minute update current weather able find forum people experiencing issue instead downloaded used weather apps point app worthless screen resolution best got used reading occasional video viewing purpose sufficient screen dimmerblue light mode read use tablet night gotten sensitive brightness tablet screen system default dimmer blue light feature awful blue light app allows set color tone however orange make unreadable app use instead called bluelight blocking even dimming brightness slider still bright download app dimly able set brightness,['battery']

Books, music, mp3 all are available through Amazon Underground. Not as many and maybe not your favorite apps are available but it is loaded with many offerings. NOTICE: by design, the tablet downloads and stores all files to an SD Card, if one is inserted. Solidly built, it will withstand child's play. The resolution is not super high but is very good for its size. I read using this tablet and the text is very clear. In fact, I use text readability as the test for evaluating a tablets resolution. After start up, you can go through simple process to connect this device with your Amazon account. This to allow purchases on the tablet. The parental controls are top notch. You can limit or allow as little or as much websites connections, limit purchases also. You can also load Google play on this tablet. With a little searching and downloading of files, you can download and play all Google Play Store Apps.-battery life is good.-speaker is good, single speaker only.-Blue Tooth connection easy. NOTE: if you have Sync (Microsoft) installed in your vehicle, the tablet will connect but has trouble reconnecting! It is Microsoft, what can you expect. You will have to unpair, delete from Sync then reconnect to get it to work in your vehicle.-I use this as my beater tablet for use outside as I do yard work, play music while in the shower (steamy environment), and when running around town. -It has 128GB SD Card expansionFor the money get more than one. I have 5 total and have given away several more as gifts.",5,positive,originally purchased practice rooting android device started using determined liked much root itit design understandable expected tied amazon everything book music mp available amazon underground many maybe favorite apps available loaded many offering notice design tablet downloads store file sd card one inserted solidly built withstand child play resolution super high good size read using tablet text clear fact use text readability test evaluating tablet resolution start go simple process connect device amazon account allow purchase tablet parental control top notch limit allow little much website connection limit purchase also also load google play tablet little searching downloading file download play google play store appsbattery life goodspeaker good single speaker onlyblue tooth connection easy note sync microsoft installed vehicle tablet connect trouble reconnecting microsoft expect unpair delete sync reconnect get work vehiclei use beater tablet use outside yard work play music shower steamy environment running around town gb sd card expansionfor money get one total given away several gift,['design']

"I have been wanting to give these little tablets a try for some time now. I went ahead and made the purchase yesterday while they were on sale. I'm originally an Apple guy, but my iPad has seen better days.The tablet is nestled in compact packaging. Inside you will find the sync cable/charger, and the tablet itself. It comes wrapped in a protective plastic bag. It looks pretty good quality, and feels great in my hands. It is very easy to grasp with one hand, leaving the other free for whatever else you may want to do.The setup is really straight forward with a few simple questions. If you are already an Amazon customer, you will be asked to input your information during setup...making it even easier to get started. The picture quality is really good for the price of the tablet. It's not HD, but the quality is still pretty good for everyday tasks. Amazon's app store is packed with tons of apps, movies, books, etc... There is definitely plenty to choose. I have access to Amazon videos, store, and everything Amazon at the palm of my hands. The only downside to the tablet is that Amazon uses its own ""Silk Browser,"" which I am not a very big fan of. I tried to see if I could download Chrome, but that is still not an option. Hopefully it will be some time in the future. The browser is a bit slow in certain web pages, but functional. Another thing that I found very useful is the simplicity of setting up my e-mail account to the tablet. The only thing that I notices was that it took a while to load my account, but the setup is very easy. You have access to pretty much everything in the palm of your hands. Overall, this tablet is a great value for anyone that is in the market for a low cost tablet.

The option has been deactivated and accordingly to the tech support, ""it's not available yet, but it will come"". Surprisingly, still according to them, none of the new Amazon tables on sale have such support! Apparently Amazon doesn't believe that open WIFI at coffee shops, supermarkets, airports offer data security risks for the tablet users.On top of that, the Amazon version of ""Google Play Store"" has a reduced number of Apps and the ones I was interested in are not available.And the cherry on the top, was that only after 15 min of small usage (I was still trying to find a way to connect to my VPN), the screen frozen and the tablet became unresponsive.Too bad!

I did find versions of a lot of favorite apps and games to download. It can take up to 128GB microSD card for expanding storage (only 8 GB built in). I got a 64 GB class 10 card at Costco for $20.Cons: screen resolution is only 1024 x 768, but I can't say it's super noticeable in normal use. Not all apps available even if an Android version exists. Much more useful if you have Amazon Prime as it ties directly to an Amazon.com account, and In fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it.

At first, I thought that I may have a faulty tablet, but I looked on Amazon's website and the Fire has a battery life of 7 hours...no wonder.The size of the Fire, though is small enough that I can take it with me when I go out and am waiting to pass the time. I also bring this with me to the gym and watch movies or read on it while I'm on the treadmill or stationary bike.I use the Fire for different things. Mainly, to play apps and stream videos on Amazon prime. For these functions, there's a little in the animation, when I play games, but it isn't frequent.I have read several books on the Fire and I must say, that I prefer to read off of the Nook HD. The print on the Fire is a little bit fuzzy and is not as crisp as the Nook.Since the Fire is from Amazon, it is locked down to only work with ""Amazon approved"" apps. As I mentioned earlier, I have a Nook as well. On that, I am able to download the Kindle app and read books that I have purchased through Amazon on the Nook. On the Fire, however, I am not able to download the Nook app so that I can read books that I have purchased through for the Nook.Overall, for the price that I paid, this is not bad.

"Don't let the 8GB prevent you from buying this Amazon tablet! Once you insert a Micro SD card, the tablet literally saves everything to the Micro SD. Be sure to get a screen protector if you plan on letting little kids play with it because the screen isn't as scratch resistant as an iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab. For Forty bucks, you just can't find a better value and with Amazon Underground, you can get a bunch of free apps which also include free in-app purchases... yup all the coins and tokens and gems and whatever else you want for free! Note that this thing comes with ads... but they only appear on the lock-screen and actually aren't that bad. They are nicely designed and don't make your lock screen look janky. Other than that, you'll want to have a PRIME membership so you can take advantage of the PRIME videos and what not. I recommend getting at least 32GB Micro SD (I believe it supports up to 128GB) to store pictures, videos, music etc... obviously get a larger capacity card if you're a download junkie.The pictures it takes are OK... good enough for viewing on a screen, but don't expect to be printing high quality pics with them.Screen quality is pretty good... not sharp and crisp like a Retina screen, but I was able to read my Kindle books just fine. The viewing angle is also decent and won't make you feel cross-eyed like some cheaper tablets out there.Battery Life is very good on this tiny tablet... something like 4-5 hours with normal use. Videos and Games will probably drain the battery faster than anything else, but it runs every game I've thrown at it so far.If you have kids, the Free-Time app is very cool... you have to pay a small subscription (like 2 bucks a month or something with PRIME) but it gives the kids access to a whole bunch of curated content, games, movies etc. just for the little ones so they don't mess with other apps or get into things your stuff.Well, that's all I can think of... this is a great little tablet of pretty good build and quality... if you're paranoid about scratches and dents get a case and screen protector and you're golden.",5,positive,dont let gb prevent buying amazon tablet insert micro sd card tablet literally save everything micro sd sure get screen protector plan letting little kid play screen isnt scratch resistant ipad samsung galaxy tab forty buck cant find better value amazon underground get bunch free apps also include free inapp purchase yup coin token gem whatever else want free note thing come ad appear lockscreen actually arent bad nicely designed dont make lock screen look janky youll want prime membership take advantage prime video recommend getting least gb micro sd believe support gb store picture video music etc obviously get larger capacity card youre download junkiethe picture take ok good enough viewing screen dont expect printing high quality pic themscreen quality pretty good sharp crisp like retina screen able read kindle book fine viewing angle also decent wont make feel crosseyed like cheaper tablet therebattery life good tiny tablet something like hour normal use video game probably drain battery faster anything else run every game ive thrown farif kid freetime app cool pay small subscription like buck month something prime give kid access whole bunch curated content game movie etc little one dont mess apps get thing stuffwell thats think great little tablet pretty good build quality youre paranoid scratch dent get case screen protector youre golden,"['quality', 'battery', 'support']"

"Purchased Blue unit - parenthesis below is error correction for that review since BB does not allow edit. Good bare bones tablet for anyone if that is all you seek. Do not expect the performance of a $400 tablet for $50. I have wifi & bluetooth going while streaming netflix and it performs fine, no lag on a reliable network.

One reason I hoped for this app would work was my Samsung and Vizio SMART TV's don't offer this app. I found a old tablet I had forgotten I had. I loaded Lifetime and works perfect. I guess what it boils down to, it you are after apps on the Playstore, get a non Amazon tablet. It is just easier to use, apps should work and you don't have to fool around trying to adapt Playstore.

"Now I know amazon prices their tablets at their manufacturing price (ie. The price it costs them to make it). They do this because they hope to make more profit off of purchases made on the device then they would having it be a competitive tablet on the market. Other tablets may have better specs but I bought this as a second 'around the house' tablet. And it does its job very well. Picture quality is more than enjoyable, the screen is bright, colors are vibrant, there's a built in blue light filter for nightime viewing (I love this feature because most apps for this are buggy or have adds). The expandable storage is very desirable especially if you like to download ebooks or lots of media. Amazon's app store has an 'underground' feature so a lot of paid apps in the Google or samsung stores are free to download here. They have free cloud storage connected to your amazon account so if your space is low you can free up space without loosing items. This also means if you want to transfer items between devices it's no probbem at all. They have a reading library that gives you access to many popular titles for a monthly fee or the bookstore itself has many free or very affordable books aswell with no monthly fee. This device can ""mirror"" a different kindle tablet so if you are replacing an old tablet it you can easily load all settings and apps onto your new one. Also, over the years amazon has been doing free updates for devices to make them run the current os. This is a nice feature when it comes to always having the newest technology, but from what I can tell it is not optional. My old tablet ran with the black carousel type os but was automatically updated overnight to the current (more visually pleasing) os. It did give me many notices stating when the update would happen and added that it would only work if the device was connected to wifi. It may be something to keep in mind if this bothers you. Overall I like this tablet very much and it is a bargin for what you're getting.",5,positive,know amazon price tablet manufacturing price ie price cost make hope make profit purchase made device would competitive tablet market tablet may better spec bought second around house tablet job well picture quality enjoyable screen bright color vibrant there built blue light filter nightime viewing love feature apps buggy add expandable storage desirable especially like download ebooks lot medium amazon app store underground feature lot paid apps google samsung store free download free cloud storage connected amazon account space low free space without loosing item also mean want transfer item device probbem reading library give access many popular title monthly fee bookstore many free affordable book aswell monthly fee device mirror different kindle tablet replacing old tablet easily load setting apps onto new one also year amazon free update device make run current o nice feature come always newest technology tell optional old tablet ran black carousel type o automatically updated overnight current visually pleasing o give many notice stating update would happen added would work device connected wifi may something keep mind bother overall like tablet much bargin youre getting,"['price', 'quality']"

"We bought WowWee MiP robots for our grandsons, 8 and 11 years old. They don't have iPad or iPhone in their home. So thoroughly researched what else would work for installing the app. Talked with Best Buy salesperson, who said the app could be loaded via the app store (it can't).Kindle Fire 2015 is included on the WowWee ""compatibility"" list. So we bought them each a brand new Kindle in order to use the app. They had Kindles from earlier years, but these wouldn't support the Bluetooth functionality needed for the robots.ABSOLUTE FAIL. We tried EVERY possible configuration (adult vs child Amazon accounts; Bluetooth on first or off first; MiP on first or off first; etc). It never worked at all ~ not even once.Also tried full factory reset on each device, loading the app via a Google Play account, rather than Amazon Kindle account. Google Play wouldn't load the app; said it wasn't compatible with this Kindle device.Opened a ticket on WowWee. The response was that they've had the same experience - the bluetooth on this Kindle fails and so the app doesn't work with the WowWee robots. They admit it fails, yet it's still on their approved list.So this was an absolute waste of money, tho at least the boys can play some free games we loaded for them.",2,negative,bought wowwee mip robot grandson year old dont ipad iphone home thoroughly researched else would work installing app talked best buy salesperson said app could loaded via app store cantkindle fire included wowwee compatibility list bought brand new kindle order use app kindles earlier year wouldnt support bluetooth functionality needed robotsabsolute fail tried every possible configuration adult v child amazon account bluetooth first first mip first first etc never worked even oncealso tried full factory reset device loading app via google play account rather amazon kindle account google play wouldnt load app said wasnt compatible kindle deviceopened ticket wowwee response theyve experience bluetooth kindle fails app doesnt work wowwee robot admit fails yet still approved listso absolute waste money tho least boy play free game loaded,['support']

"This 7"" 2015 version should have been marketed to children only. It's like a very ""dumbed"" down, cheap version of the better FireHD and HDX. Screen is not as good, battery life is bad, no mirroring to TV and it's slooowww as can be. If you've never owned another kind of Kindle you will probably be accepting of this watered down version. For those that know what a real kindle should be like, you may want to pass on this one. Another version should be along soon and since they can't get much worse than this one you'll probably get a better one.

If the display did not have these pixel issues I could see this easily being a 4 Star recommendation.

"I purchased the new Kindle Tablet not really knowing what to expect..I didn't read any reviews before hand, nor did I try the one in store. After getting home, charging, and applying updates I noticed there are numerous bright/stuck pixels at least 8. It's only noticeable on dark screens. I understand the devices limitations verses price but you would expect to at least have a functional screen with maybe 1 pixel issue at most.As I mentioned above when you plug it in and turn it on it immediately starts an update, that process took a good thirty minutes to complete. Upon first boot I went to register with my Amazon account but it returned some funky error message, I tried again and it said the device was already registered, so I was unable to complete the setup/walk through. I'm a very technical user so this wasn't too big of an issue, but I could see where it could be for someone that isn't savvy with computers/tablets.All that said in use, it runs decently, and def better then you would expect a Tablet at this price point to run.

"I was looking for a good, cheap tablet for general use, and this fit the bill. The one thing that hits you outright is the build-in marketing Amazon uses in the tablet that you cannot remove. For instance, the home screen is filled with links for Amazon Video, Amazon Books, Amazon Gifts, etc, etc. You an't remove them, but I found out you can create a folder and drag each into that folder to essentially remove them.After that, install a free app for a File Manager then go in and rename the folder(s) that you create to make it easier to find apps that you hide. You will also need to install Adobe Reader to read PDF files, since it isn't installed.Another marketing scheme is that the screen saver is an ad each and every time you wake it. After a while though you get to ignore it.Performance is great - fast and easy to navigate. The built-in browser has everything you should need. Battery life looks really good. I had the screen brightness at about 1/2 power and it looked good. The screen black level is really good and the contrast makes the colors sparkle. If you turn the brightness up too high, the colors begin to wash out a little.Amazon seems to offer this tablet at a lower price in exchange for their promotions of Amazon products.

"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",5,positive,casual user ondemand content device tried smart tv brand smart dvdbluray player apple tv wdtv htpc chromecast many competing product mentionfor streaming content box really two option simple use box doesnt require additional item tweakingfirst apple tv easy use interface apple limit content get greatly including prime streaming built lack lot feature well slow reason selecting apple tv apple product unlock feature like amazon contentthe second option could consider rokuwhich really mean roku box since head tail better past roku box term remote speed roku stand content feature box roku reason see address roku often reviewi added quick summary option make sure everyone know option therewdtv great streaming content user friendlychromecast cheap requires item use remote included limited channel according site content broadcast via chrome browser quality level allow browse internet tv amazing cost niche market firetvrokuapple tv live short coming worth look price devicessmart tv fine occasional use nearly pleasant use daily like separate boxesread,"['price', 'quality']"

"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this.

"Overall it's a nice looking cover and does it's job well. It's simple, elegant and slick. When I say slick, I don't necessarily mean cleverly devised, I mean slippery. The smooth leather provides next to no grip on the cover. I have a tendency to hold things lightly, so I can just imagine this repeatedly slipping out of my hand. Sure it doesn't have a band/clasp/etc to keep it closed, but neither did Kindle 2's cover, and neither does nearly every book ever published.It's too expensive.

"So in reading the reviews before I got this cover I was quite worried... lots of people reported it feeling cheap, flimsy, overpriced etc. I was so concerned in fact I tried to cancel my order. I'm glad I wasn't able to.It is perhaps not what people expect- the leather is not soft, but is rather pressed and almost polished. However, this cover does NOT feel cheap to me. It is stylish, super light, and fits the kindle without those annoying elastic loops or hooks on the corners. It fits within a rubberized groove on the cover, which not only gives it a very tight and secure fit, it also adds protection to the corners of the device and cover. It also feels quite secure in the hand.So, to sum up: Light, secure, well made and unobtrusive. The 40 price tag could be debated, but I actually don't find it to be overpriced. I'm quite happy with it!",5,positive,reading review got cover quite worried lot people reported feeling cheap flimsy overpriced etc concerned fact tried cancel order im glad wasnt able toit perhaps people expect leather soft rather pressed almost polished however cover feel cheap stylish super light fit kindle without annoying elastic loop hook corner fit within rubberized groove cover give tight secure fit also add protection corner device cover also feel quite secure handso sum light secure well made unobtrusive price tag could debated actually dont find overpriced im quite happy,['price']
"I don't want to get too negative on this, because it does what it's supposed to. However, I'm not sure how Amazon justifies charging 40! Half that and I'd feel a lot less disappointed. It's nothing like the last generation cover, which was hefty and substantial. That thing could take a beating! This one Umm...not so much.PROS:- I really like the solution Amazon came up with to lock the Kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it VERY securely. No more metal-prong slide-release gizmo.- It looks quite nice and is genuine (if untextured) leather like the last one.CONS:- Flimsy. The leather is extremely thin and unpadded. Won't stand up to much abuse. scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you'll likely ruin it.- The actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate -- it's about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard. I could bend it in half with almost no effort, if I had the notion.- Cover has no lock/closure mechanism (like the elastic strap on the last gen model). It should have SOMETHING.Oh, well. It is what it is. I never read with the Kindle in the case anyway so it's not such a big deal to me, but I was expecting more. Especially for this price!",2,negative,dont want get negative supposed however im sure amazon justifies charging half id feel lot less disappointed nothing like last generation cover hefty substantial thing could take beating one ummnot muchpros really like solution amazon came lock kindle place sort rubberized cup grip four side hold securely metalprong sliderelease gizmo look quite nice genuine untextured leather like last onecons flimsy leather extremely thin unpadded wont stand much abuse scrape even lightly rough surface youll likely ruin actual cover fold front incredibly floppy delicate thickness piece notepad cardboard could bend half almost effort notion cover lockclosure mechanism like elastic strap last gen model somethingoh well never read kindle case anyway big deal expecting especially price,['price']
"Okay, so I have been debating for days on whether to rate this thing 3 or 4 stars, and I still want to rate it 3 and a half, but I have settled for 4 stars. Here is why.PROSThe only real reason I wanted this case over the others is because every other case holds the Kindle in with straps around the edges, and this is the only case that holds the Kindle in while letting you see the whole front side. It holds it in perfectly, neither feeling loose or too tight to get it out. The black leather is genuine leather and smells nice, and while the front cover is very thin (if you tap on it you get a hollow drum sound, and it can be bent without much effort) it takes mild amounts of abuse without a problem. Also, the flap folds back perfectly and when you are reading, you hardly notice the Kindle has a case on.CONSMy main complaint is the quality of the leather. If you compare this to the case for the Kindle 3 (keyboard) the leather is a little thinner but much less durable. I sometimes lightly hold my Kindle between my teeth when I run out of hands, and after a week I can still see my tooth marks (whereas on the K3 case I couldn't). Also, even a mild scratch will either take several days to disappear. UPDATE: Most scratches will mostly disappear so its not as big a problem as I originally thought.The only other complaint is of course the lack of anything to hold the cover closed, but this has actually not been much of a problem for me. Quite often I like to frisbee toss my Kindle onto a nearby soft surface (like carpet or a pillow or bed) and I was afraid the cover would flap open every time, but 10 times out of the 11 I tried it stayed shut just fine.Read more",4,positive,okay debating day whether rate thing star still want rate half settled star whyprosthe real reason wanted case others every case hold kindle strap around edge case hold kindle letting see whole front side hold perfectly neither feeling loose tight get black leather genuine leather smell nice front cover thin tap get hollow drum sound bent without much effort take mild amount abuse without problem also flap fold back perfectly reading hardly notice kindle case onconsmy main complaint quality leather compare case kindle keyboard leather little thinner much less durable sometimes lightly hold kindle teeth run hand week still see tooth mark whereas k case couldnt also even mild scratch either take several day disappear update scratch mostly disappear big problem originally thoughtthe complaint course lack anything hold cover closed actually much problem quite often like frisbee toss kindle onto nearby soft surface like carpet pillow bed afraid cover would flap open every time time tried stayed shut fineread,['quality']

"This is the third Kindle Fire in my household, but the first kid's edition. I absolutely love this thing. It's very intuitive if you've ever used another android style device. My 6 year old and 3 year old both have a their own profile, each linked with different movies/games. Setup was pretty easy with choosing preferred content based on characters/themes appropriate for their age group. Moving our Disney and other digital copies of movies was equally easy after signing in. The battery lasts about 4.5 hours before needing a charge, which is plenty for our use. The biggest complaint is that the micro USB connection isn't the best. The cord has a tendency to come loose and stop charging if the device is jostled even the tiniest amount. I've seen this problem with other Kindles as well. This is aa bunch problem if you think that you're charging it overnight only to find out that it stopped when you set it down. It also makes it very difficult to use during a charge. The amazing amount of content that you get from the Amazon library with the included year is nice as well. My 6 year old gets to try a bunch of games that I otherwise wouldn't let him try since I'd have to pay and he most likely get tired of after 5 minutes.

Why couldn't they just leave the home page showing the small pictures of the books you bought? I have no idea what My Reading List is - it lists books I've never heard of, by authors and topics of which I have no interest. Still, I would recommend a Kindle to anyone who reads books. The screen is easy to read, you can make the fonts bigger or smaller. I don't feel the battery lasts any longer than my old one did, but it's easy to charge.

"This is my first kindle purchase, and I couldn't be happier with it. Before I bought it I was very concerned that it would be too small for me to enjoy reading on, but my concern was soon expunged. I have always read books, then as I grew older and my eye sight grew worse, I moved to reading on my iPad Air because I could increase the size of the print. The downside to my iPad though, was that it would get heavy to hold as I read, and after a while I would get some eye strain from the light being projected out from the device, even in night mode to a point, even though that was much better. So I decided to try the Kindle Paperwhite with the new 300 ppi type. I couldn't be happier with it. It's light to hold, even in one hand, which I do a lot, I can still adjust the type size to what I want, the type is very crisp and easy to read, and I find that I don't get the eye strain that I used to. One other benefit to the Kindle is that reading outside is even better than reading inside, which can not be said for the iPad.Another benefit to the Kindle is that if I still feel like reading the book for a while on my iPad, using the free Kindle app, my iPad syncs perfectly with my Kindle, so that it will start on the same page that I stopped on with my Kindle, so that I can seamlessly move from one device to the other.The only slight disappointment that I had with it, was that the battery doesn't last as long as they lead you to believe. I found myself having to recharge it about two thirds the way through the book, but realistically that's no big deal to me.If you are debating on whether or not the Kindle Paperwhite would be right for you to read on, my recommendation is to buy it. I don't think that you will be disappointed.",5,positive,first kindle purchase couldnt happier bought concerned would small enjoy reading concern soon expunged always read book grew older eye sight grew worse moved reading ipad air could increase size print downside ipad though would get heavy hold read would get eye strain light projected device even night mode point even though much better decided try kindle paperwhite new ppi type couldnt happier light hold even one hand lot still adjust type size want type crisp easy read find dont get eye strain used one benefit kindle reading outside even better reading inside said ipadanother benefit kindle still feel like reading book ipad using free kindle app ipad syncs perfectly kindle start page stopped kindle seamlessly move one device otherthe slight disappointment battery doesnt last long lead believe found recharge two third way book realistically thats big deal meif debating whether kindle paperwhite would right read recommendation buy dont think disappointed,['battery']

"With this 3rd generation of the Kindle Paperwhite, Amazon really created the best reading experience for a reasonable price. I previously owned a first generation Paperwhite, and the increase in resolution (300ppi, up from 212ppi) is really noticeable. After reading on this for a while, it is slightly disturbing to see jagged edges around text of the older Paperwhite. The white balance of the screen has also improved, with a slightly warmer, book-ish experience instead of the cooler, electronic-display-ish screen of the old on. Additionally, the screen can get crazy low in brightness! Ideal for someone who prefers to read in bed at night with the lights turned off.. if you thought the previous Kindles got dark, this takes it to a whole new level of dimness.",5,positive,rd generation kindle paperwhite amazon really created best reading experience reasonable price previously owned first generation paperwhite increase resolution ppi ppi really noticeable reading slightly disturbing see jagged edge around text older paperwhite white balance screen also improved slightly warmer bookish experience instead cooler electronicdisplayish screen old additionally screen get crazy low brightness ideal someone prefers read bed night light turned thought previous kindles got dark take whole new level dimness,['price']
"This review comes with a caveat. Many tech sites say e-readers are dying, kind of like the ""Nintendo is doooooomed"" crowd, or the GPS is obsolete argument. I don't disagree. As our phones become more sophisticated and the phone screen sizes continue to balloon up to tablet-like proportions, dedicated devices will continue to go the way of the dodo. But sometimes, if you're interested enough, a dedicated device is precisely what you need. I had (key word: ""had"") an ipad mini 2 that I had been using as my all-round in-bed Netflix + reading machine. Except I'd get about 3 seconds in before getting nudged by my wife due to half the room being lit up. As I spend more time reading on my ipad than watching Netflix, I decided to sell my ipad mini and just buy 2 kindles - one for my wife and myself. The new Kindle Paperwhite feels just as solid as the outgoing model, but the resolution is now 300 dpi. The e-ink screen almost feels like a page of a paperback when you swipe, and in my personal preference, I like that.The battery is rated to last 6-8 weeks on average between the various tech sites, which trumps my ipad mini by several life cycles. Yes the screen has to refresh unlike a tablet, but it's not very noticeable and I don't find it distracting at all for reading.Cases aren't nearly as ubiquitous as for the ipad, so you've basically got the standard Amazon-branded leather case or offbrand cases from sites like Ebay.I enjoy reading, and I frankly don't want to wear any thicker glasses than I already have. Backlight can cause bad eye strain, so that's another plus for the Kindle over the iPad.In summary, TL;DR: if you want a dedicated e-reader, you can't go wrong with the Kindle PW. The price:performance ratio is much better than the Voyage IMHO.But that's assuming that you're somebody who spends enough time reading to make the Kindle device worth carrying. If you only read for a few seconds here and there, adding an extra device to lug around isn't for you. So like a Garmin, the market has a specific niche and YMMV depending on your needs.

"This is my first ereader. I've wanted one for awhile but wasn't impressed with features until the two most recent versions of Paperwhite were released (I have the latest version). I've read a few books and several magazines on it, so at this point I'm familiar with it. Basic functionality is excellent. For reading text it's pretty straightforward; magazine articles with images worked well for me, but I can see where screen formatting could be an issue for more complex illustrations. The backlight is very good (I wouldn't buy an ereader without it). Pages flips are lightening fast, and the touch screen is mostly quite responsive with minimal pressure (I have a few complaints, see below). Nice integration with the Amazon leather cover, you can just close the book and it shuts down. Buying books from Amazon is simple, and they are delivered via my home WiFi in seconds. Battery life seems endless, and recharge is simple (the included cable charges via a PC, wall charger is an accessory you must purchase). Great device for older readers, as you can kick up the font size and lighting for squint-free reading. It's about the size of a small paperback book and as light as a feather.My complaints: 1) Ads are mildly annoying, it's aggravating to pay more for an ad-free version; 2) Availability of books from my local library remain shockingly limited, even though these devices are hardly new; 3) The Amazon library for book loans (available for a monthly fee) is also very limited. I had a 30-day trial period, during which time I searched for several classic novels on both Amazon and my local library -- big fat zero across the board for my entire reading list. Want to read Catch-22 or Atlas Shrugged? You've got to buy it. ; 4) Highlighting is clumsy using a finger, although I've improved over time. Changing the highlighted area by dragging the electronic tabs is useless; 5) If you like to flip through a book, the Paperwhite will take you to the furthest page touched when you reopen the book. If you've read 50 pages, but went forward to see something on pages 180-190, you'll return to 191 next time. If you flip around a lot you'll get a real mess. Manual bookmarks are the only solution. 6) It's my understanding that when you buy a book from Amazon, you are getting a license to read that book on an Amazon device only (you are not getting a generic ebook that will work forever on any device). So if you buy a different brand of ereader 5 years from now you'll have to rebuy your library.Despite all this, I'm glad I bought it and would recommend it if you'd like a dedicated ereader versus a tablet.",5,positive,first ereader ive wanted one awhile wasnt impressed feature two recent version paperwhite released latest version ive read book several magazine point im familiar basic functionality excellent reading text pretty straightforward magazine article image worked well see screen formatting could issue complex illustration backlight good wouldnt buy ereader without page flip lightening fast touch screen mostly quite responsive minimal pressure complaint see nice integration amazon leather cover close book shuts buying book amazon simple delivered via home wifi second battery life seems endless recharge simple included cable charge via pc wall charger accessory must purchase great device older reader kick font size lighting squintfree reading size small paperback book light feathermy complaint ad mildly annoying aggravating pay adfree version availability book local library remain shockingly limited even though device hardly new amazon library book loan available monthly fee also limited day trial period time searched several classic novel amazon local library big fat zero across board entire reading list want read catch atlas shrugged youve got buy highlighting clumsy using finger although ive improved time changing highlighted area dragging electronic tab useless like flip book paperwhite take furthest page touched reopen book youve read page went forward see something page youll return next time flip around lot youll get real mess manual bookmark solution understanding buy book amazon getting license read book amazon device getting generic ebook work forever device buy different brand ereader year youll rebuy librarydespite im glad bought would recommend youd like dedicated ereader versus tablet,['battery']

"I had a kindle Paperwhite that I'd bought in summer 2014, and by summer 2015 something had gone funky- it wasn't charging anymore. So I upgraded to one with a higher PPI a couple months ago. The difference is slight; in fact I haven't noticed it at all. If I went back to my old Kindle I'd probably notice that the quality had changed, but really, it's a very minor upgrade. But that doesn't matter- because the Paperwhite is awesome anyway! I am a woman, and I can fit it in the back pocket of most of my jeans (so dudes definitely can), it slips into small purses and it holds a charge for weeks. I have a pretty big collection of physical books, but I really enjoy having a library on a tablet that I can bring with me too. I buy physical books when I want to linger around a book store, or for poetry, or books that I want to high light or share with people, or that I like the covers of. I buy Kindle books that I really want for the story, or that are on sale on the Kindle store, or classics that are cheap (a couple bucks) or free. The Vocabulary Builder is really nice- I just highlight and lookup words that I want to know more about, then it provides a definition for me and saves the word as a flash card so that I can practice later at my convenience. I use my Kindle at night- the back light is perfect for reading right before bed. I wholeheartedly recommend this device if you just want a reading tablet.

"Purchased this as an upgrade to the first generation Kindle Paperwhite. The backlight is greatly improved, the display is of a higher quality, the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker — opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier.The one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation Paperwhite is the way it's manufactured — when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see a small section of the display covered in the e-ink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen. At first I thought this was a manufacturing defect, so I took it back to Best Buy and exchanged it for the same model, only to find that the second model had the same issue, except more-visible.This appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process. When the Paperwhite first came out, it was the crown jewel of Amazon's e-reader line, and Amazon was careful to precision-craft the devices. Now, that honor falls to the more-expensive Voyage, with the Paperwhite becoming the flagship, but still cheaper, option in the Kindle lineup, meaning the manufacturing quality of the Paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the Voyage.This won't be a huge annoyance for some people. It is for me. And it's seriously made me consider whether it's worth contacting Amazon over.For everyone else, though, this is a great e-reader and well worth the money.

"I read as many reviews as I could find before buying this newest Paperwhite and what struck me the most was the contrast of the bright screen versus the print. However, when I got mine, I had to put the brightness level to 19 (out of 25) to get it to a comfortable setting. Doing that makes my battery run down before I've even read two books, and that is with the airplane setting on, meaning the WIFI is off. Luckily, I bought a charger so I can charge my Paperwhite while on trips ( without my computer, in a regular outlet) or at night when I'm finished reading. Now for the positives. I love the light weight of this Kindle even with the preferred cover that shuts it into sleep mode when closed. I absolutely LOVE the dictionary feature, because it is so easy to use and it saves the words I don't know, for study. After I've learned a word's meaning, I can delete it from the list. I got the Paperwhite with the ads, because it is nice getting suggestions of books I might enjoy that I might not see otherwise. And books are easy to order from the Kindle Store and to download through this devise.

It's very light and feels great in your hands. The screen is amazing and I never have any kind of issues with being unable to see it due to sunlight, a dark room, etc. But probably most amazing of all is the battery life.

"I was a previous Voyage owner for a year but then left it on a plane (don't forget to check the seat-back pocket before you leave!). I was debating whether to buy it again but all the reviews I saw online said it wasn't worth the $80 premium - they're right.First off, the resolution is the exact same 300 ppi on both models. The Voyage does have better contrast but it's something I stopped noticing after 24 hours. The backlighting on the Paperwhite also isn't as even, as I notice it's darker on the bottom but again, I stopped caring after a few uses. The weight difference is negligible and they both have incredibly long battery lives.About the only time I miss the Voyage is when it comes to the page turn buttons. On the Paperwhite, I have to touch the screen, so when I'm lying in bed, I'm forced to use two hands to avoid it from falling on my face. With the Voyage, I could just press the page ""button"" and keep my hands on the border. Again, far from a deal breaker and something I adjusted to quickly.Overall, the Voyage is the better Kindle but not worth the premium cost.",5,positive,previous voyage owner year left plane dont forget check seatback pocket leave debating whether buy review saw online said wasnt worth premium theyre rightfirst resolution exact ppi model voyage better contrast something stopped noticing hour backlighting paperwhite also isnt even notice darker bottom stopped caring us weight difference negligible incredibly long battery livesabout time miss voyage come page turn button paperwhite touch screen im lying bed im forced use two hand avoid falling face voyage could press page button keep hand border far deal breaker something adjusted quicklyoverall voyage better kindle worth premium cost,['battery']

"Well, it happened. I became a huge fan of e-books, preferring them over an actual, physical book! This old fashioned woman with a preference for all that is vintage NEVER EVER thought that would happen; then came the Kindle Paperwhite. I think I have read close to 10 books this past month because of the Paperwhite! I can make the font larger (which is great for my old eyes), and it is lit from the side, so it does not make my eyes tired like typical LCD screens, where the light shoots up at your eyes. Because of this, you can read easily in bright sun or in total darkness. Also, the battery lasts a very long time; I usually have to charge it only after reading a full book. And an added bonus is that you can't get any apps on the Paperwhite, which sounds like a negative, but that means there is no distraction/temptation to surf the web instead of read. When you open it up, you are committed to reading. It is sooooo much better than my Nook, which makes my eyes tired and is a distraction.It is among the best purchases I have ever made!",5,positive,well happened became huge fan ebooks preferring actual physical book old fashioned woman preference vintage never ever thought would happen came kindle paperwhite think read close book past month paperwhite make font larger great old eye lit side make eye tired like typical lcd screen light shoot eye read easily bright sun total darkness also battery last long time usually charge reading full book added bonus cant get apps paperwhite sound like negative mean distractiontemptation surf web instead read open committed reading sooooo much better nook make eye tired distractionit among best purchase ever made,['battery']

I read reviews about the original kindle being hard to read in the dark, and that's when I would be reading the most. If I had seen how hard it really as to read, it would have gone back immediately.The weight is a little heavy for constant reading but nothing to really complain about. The battery life could supposedly last 8 weeks. But, apparently I am a bookworm. I have to charge it every other day with max settings.One thing I am thrilled the most about is the easy of accessing a dictionary or encyclopedia, the notes, and the highlighting.

"An 'okay' reader. Reading from an iPad mini is better under all conditions except outside in sunlight. Plus, with the iPad you can play games, web search, etc. The Kindle library function is not nearly as good as the Kindle app on the iPad where you can see many more of your books on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the Kindle. I also do not like the page turn of the Kindle versus Apple. Every page turned on Kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely. I actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the Kindle slow page turn. Even the reading in the outdoors feature of the Kindle is not as great as reviewers indicate as there is still the sun glare on pages that you have to deal with, although at least you can read with it outdoors. The Kindle also suffers from a 'shadow' along the bottom of the screen. The explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the lights that are shining upward for night time reading. Draw your own conclusions as to whether that is good engineering. It is worse on some of the devices I saw than on others. Kindle serves the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently gets damaged. I would never take an iPad to the beach, but the Kindle is almost 'disposable' in contrast. Maybe 3 stars is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the iPad. If Apple ever makes their device so it can be used outside without a glare, then I don't see any market for the Kindle at that point. Not sorry I have a Kindle, but for what I decided to buy it for (reading at beach) it is at the price point where it is not really worth it. I still read ""paper"" books for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading.",3,neutral,okay reader reading ipad mini better condition except outside sunlight plus ipad play game web search etc kindle library function nearly good kindle app ipad see many book page scroll quickly versus slow swipe function kindle also like page turn kindle versus apple every page turned kindle like slow motion every fifth page refreshes entirely actually go top next page slowly order wait kindle slow page turn even reading outdoors feature kindle great reviewer indicate still sun glare page deal although least read outdoors kindle also suffers shadow along bottom screen explanation actually shadow light shining upward night time reading draw conclusion whether good engineering worse device saw others kindle serf purpose reading beach worrying accidently get damaged would never take ipad beach kindle almost disposable contrast maybe star bit generous good supplement ipad apple ever make device used outside without glare dont see market kindle point sorry kindle decided buy reading beach price point really worth still read paper book remember still work perfectly beach reading,['price']

"There is nothing else left on the eink market anyway but the Amazon Kindle. It still doesn't support epub format of course, Amazon doesn't like competition. It is built OK, moderately cheap plastic, but no squeaking at least. Contrast is OK, I had Nook and it is on par. I can't imagine how bad the regular Kindle would be though. This one with 300 dpi is just OK. Scrolling is fast enough, it has integrated vocabulary. No home menu or other physical buttons though, besides the home Kindle one - the UI is not completely responsive when you try to go to your Library, instead home brings you to Amazon Kindle page, where you are overwhelmed with advertisement.My biggest dislike is the volume of advertisement and thus the convoluted interface. It is WAY worse then Nook, which is much more reading-centric.A lot of cheap and free books are available on Amazon, especially with Prime membership.

"I broke my Kindle Voyage after almost two years. My heart was as broken as the glass cover!After looking at the latest line of Kindles I decided to try the latest Paperwhite as it had the same screen resolution and was a lot cheaper. Plus, a white model to match my other white/silver gadgets! It does have a few less LEDs for backlighting, no flush glass cover (but that is what broke), no auto-adjusting light (that never quite worked anyway), squeezy sides, and a tiny bit heavier/bigger than the Voyage. The Voyage also has had no hardware updates since it was released and the new crazy-expensive Kindle uses leather and has no not-leather option for people who don't like their high tech wrapped in animal skins. So instead of saving up for a while and reading on my phone, I sprung for the Paperwhite.I've been using this for about a month and the quality has impressed me. I don't miss the glass cover as much as I thought I would, although sometimes pet hair will get caught between the bezel and the screen and need to be pulled out. The screen is great, doesn't clash with the white casing, and although not quite as even a backlight as the Voyage, still much better value for what you get. The software is essentially the same, and Amazon has been slowly improving Kindle software for all the recent models.If you like Amazon for books, I highly recommend this Kindle. You can't beat it for price/value and it really doesn't feel any heavier even after an hour or two curled up with your books.",5,positive,broke kindle voyage almost two year heart broken glass coverafter looking latest line kindles decided try latest paperwhite screen resolution lot cheaper plus white model match whitesilver gadget less led backlighting flush glass cover broke autoadjusting light never quite worked anyway squeezy side tiny bit heavierbigger voyage voyage also hardware update since released new crazyexpensive kindle us leather notleather option people dont like high tech wrapped animal skin instead saving reading phone sprung paperwhiteive using month quality impressed dont miss glass cover much thought would although sometimes pet hair get caught bezel screen need pulled screen great doesnt clash white casing although quite even backlight voyage still much better value get software essentially amazon slowly improving kindle software recent modelsif like amazon book highly recommend kindle cant beat pricevalue really doesnt feel heavier even hour two curled book,['quality']

One thing i noticed was there is the kindle lending library, it only allows 1 book to be borrowed per month.

"Purchased to replace an older model that died during a software update (lost wifi connection during the download, bricking the kindle). This model has 300dpi, up from 220 on the previous model. With text it is barely, if at all, noticeable. With any kind of graphics or cover images, the increase in resolution is nicer. Unfortunately the lighting remains uneven at the bottom of the screen as it was in the previous generation. The voyager model supposedly has better lighting but at twice the price it wasn't worth it to me. And the uneven bottom lighting isn't bad, but it is there and I would have thought Amazon would have fixed that by now. Maybe it is a limitation of having 4 light sources vs the 6 on the voyager. Still, the lighting is not bad and this is a very nice eReader. Noticed the background is a touch more beige than the grey on the previous model which is a welcome subtle change, easier on the eyes. Like too that the font is a dark grey versus pitch black which also reduces eye strain especially for those with dyslexia who can be sensitive to harsh contrasts. Overall, highly recommended. Best eReader for the price.",4,positive,purchased replace older model died software update lost wifi connection download bricking kindle model dpi previous model text barely noticeable kind graphic cover image increase resolution nicer unfortunately lighting remains uneven bottom screen previous generation voyager model supposedly better lighting twice price wasnt worth uneven bottom lighting isnt bad would thought amazon would fixed maybe limitation light source v voyager still lighting bad nice ereader noticed background touch beige grey previous model welcome subtle change easier eye like font dark grey versus pitch black also reduces eye strain especially dyslexia sensitive harsh contrast overall highly recommended best ereader price,['price']

I was attracted by the price of the base Kindle but in the end opted for the Paperwhite as it was illuminated and had rounded edges which felt more comfortable.

"I had this device for few weeks before returning it and getting the Kindle Voyage.

This device has reinvigorated my live for reading since it is so portable and the battery lasts for quite a while.

Overall, I would recommend anyone that wants to read more, reads often, or reads many books at once to take the plunge and buy this device. Plus, new books can be upwards of $20-$30 sometimes.

"I originally purchased the Paper White and after a week of that, I decided to upgrade to the Voyage for a couple reasons. 1) Perhaps my phone has made me lazy but I've grown accustomed to auto-brightness. It's something that I don't even really think of at all... until you have to manually adjust it. The Voyage is currently the only Kindle that automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen. I've read reviews that question the efficacy of it, and those people tend to say it's hit or miss. I humbly submit that that is because it's a 'smart' auto-brightness that adjusts to your preferences at certain light levels. For instance if you're in a dimly lit room and the screen is too bright for you there, and you manually turn it down a few notches the next time you're in that room, the Kindle will remember what your screen brightness preference was at that light level and adjust. I have had NO problems with this feature and consider it the most indispensable feature on the Kindle. It's brilliant.2) Page turn haptic buttons. These are great, and allow me to not need to move my hand at all to turn a page, I simply squeeze. I do wish they had been placed slightly higher on the device as I find I've needed to adjust my grip lower than I normally would have held on to the device. It's very nice having the option to not need to swipe the page to turn it.3) The flush screen. This makes a big difference to me - I was not a fan of the recessed screen on the Paper White and even the Nook has a flush screen! Amazon really needs to introduce waterproof Kindles and a flush screen is going to be necessary for that. This is also my only negative about the device - the screen appears to be slightly more reflective than the Paper White and I've heard (wether it's true or not) that is because the Voyage has a glass screen, while the Paper White has plastic? I'm not sure, but the ONLY time I notice this is when I'm reading the the sun is directly behind me. I may need to tilt the screen 5 degrees in any direction and it's easily readable again.4) The general design is sleeker and feels better in my hand than the Paper White. This also allows the device to be slightly lighter than the Paper White, which is always a good thing.To recap - This is the ONLY Kindle to feature the auto-brightness feature (not even the Oasis has it--probably to save on weight) and in my opinion a worthy upgrade over the Paper White.",5,positive,originally purchased paper white week decided upgrade voyage couple reason perhaps phone made lazy ive grown accustomed autobrightness something dont even really think manually adjust voyage currently kindle automatically adjusts brightness screen ive read review question efficacy people tend say hit miss humbly submit smart autobrightness adjusts preference certain light level instance youre dimly lit room screen bright manually turn notch next time youre room kindle remember screen brightness preference light level adjust problem feature consider indispensable feature kindle brilliant page turn haptic button great allow need move hand turn page simply squeeze wish placed slightly higher device find ive needed adjust grip lower normally would held device nice option need swipe page turn flush screen make big difference fan recessed screen paper white even nook flush screen amazon really need introduce waterproof kindles flush screen going necessary also negative device screen appears slightly reflective paper white ive heard wether true voyage glass screen paper white plastic im sure time notice im reading sun directly behind may need tilt screen degree direction easily readable general design sleeker feel better hand paper white also allows device slightly lighter paper white always good thingto recap kindle feature autobrightness feature even oasis itprobably save weight opinion worthy upgrade paper white,['design']

"I just upgraded from a Touch to a Voyage and could not be happier. In my opinion this is by far the best Kindle yet. Its operation and features are similar to the Touch and Paperwhite but it is lighter and faster and very comfortable in the hand. Like other e-ink devices (unlike Fire) the screen has a matte finish which is really superb for reading. Some early reviews I've read complained about part of the screen having a yellowish hue. I have not seen any sign of this so that may have been an early manufacturing issue that hopefully has been corrected. The built-in screen light is amazing.Like other e-ink devices the Voyage allows better control and integration of dictionaries, which is really important for specialized reading or reading in a foreign language where one may want to consult several dictionaries in-situ to fully understand a word or phrase.There is very little not to like about the Voyage. I can only think of two issues to consider:1. Price - no doubt about it, Voyage is expensive, but in my opinion it is worth it. When trading off price and performance, I urge you to go into your nearest Best Buy for a hands-on look at the various Kindles, particularly the Paperwhite and Voyage to see what you really need/want or can live with.2. A minor point for the evolution of e-ink readers: it would be nice if there was some control of the screen background color or at least an implementation of a warmer background. Recent studies suggest adverse effects, particularly regarding getting good sleep, from using electronic devices with bright-white or bluish screens (disrupts melatonin production in the body). This is one (of the few in my opinion) advantages of Kindle Fire and Kindle for Android, where several text background colors are available).I highly recommend Voyage - the new king of e-readers.",5,positive,upgraded touch voyage could happier opinion far best kindle yet operation feature similar touch paperwhite lighter faster comfortable hand like eink device unlike fire screen matte finish really superb reading early review ive read complained part screen yellowish hue seen sign may early manufacturing issue hopefully corrected builtin screen light amazinglike eink device voyage allows better control integration dictionary really important specialized reading reading foreign language one may want consult several dictionary insitu fully understand word phrasethere little like voyage think two issue consider price doubt voyage expensive opinion worth trading price performance urge go nearest best buy handson look various kindles particularly paperwhite voyage see really needwant live minor point evolution eink reader would nice control screen background color least implementation warmer background recent study suggest adverse effect particularly regarding getting good sleep using electronic device brightwhite bluish screen disrupts melatonin production body one opinion advantage kindle fire kindle android several text background color availablei highly recommend voyage new king ereaders,"['price', 'performance']"

The buttons make it so easy to hold the Kindle with one hand and turn pages.Lastly the screen. I marked off a star because I had to return my first Voyage directly to Amazon because the top half of the screen had a yellow tint to it that was very distracting while reading. The replacement Kindle Voyage that I received had a perfect screen and the 300 ppi looks amazing. That being said, Amazon needs to really focus on quality control because I've read that the yellow tint on the screen is a common issue. If you're spending $200 for an e-reader, then the screen should be perfect. Especially since this is the 3rd generation of the lighted screens for the e-readers.If you're an avid reader, then the Kindle Voyage would be a worthy upgrade to make.

Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-(",1,negative,disappointed kindle voyage purchased april failed two us went charge tonight take business trip wont charge wont reset etc since best buy receipt say day return tried calling amazon support solution minute phone process replacement may new may refurbished device unacceptable replace less month old device refurbished one given poor experience ive voyage im even comfortable new replacement point amazon say cant anything refund purchased best buy day seems little extreme situation like defective productstuck paperweight,['support']
"Hands down the best ereader available. I researched several devices and it came down to the Paperwhite and the Voyage. There is a pretty hefty price premium for the Voyage. Most people will probably be very satisfied with the Paperwhite. I typically need reading glasses to read regular size print. On an eReader the font can be adjusted to make it large enough so I don't need to use the glasses. That means less text on each page and many more page turns. The physical ""buttons"" hep make the page turns easier and extra light brightness helps to add contrast to the text. These were enough to sell me on the Voyage. It was the right decision and I love the device.",4,positive,hand best ereader available researched several device came paperwhite voyage pretty hefty price premium voyage people probably satisfied paperwhite typically need reading glass read regular size print ereader font adjusted make large enough dont need use glass mean less text page many page turn physical button hep make page turn easier extra light brightness help add contrast text enough sell voyage right decision love device,['price']

Kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here. I use my Kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time.

"First, the good news. The screen is a nice brightness and the words are crisp and clear. Best of all, it is so light and tiny (esp. in the Origami case) that it is super-easy to carry around in a purse. Love that. Also it has an amazing battery life; I have never had it run out on me and I don't even have to recharge it all the time. I thought this would be perfect but I am having two problems: (1) turning pages is not as easy or pleasant as my much-older, now-defunct Kindle. If I don't touch the screen in the right place, the page won't turn, and it usually has an annoying split-second black flash on the screen. The ancient Kindle was easier. (2) About half the time, when I return to reading, the screen is ""frozen"" on the ad. It says ""swipe to open"" but no amount of swiping gets it going. I have to reach to the rear of the kindle (which means disassembling the crimp in the Origami) to press the button on the back to get it to function again.

Practically any book at the palm of my hand on this one device. I also like that it has page press which is outer press buttons for page turning. One con is its not all that speedy and responsive when going though the store, though it is the fastest kindle yet. I would NOT say it is 80 to 100 dollars well spent over the paperweight.

"I was fortunate to order one of these as soon as it was announced. As an Amazon Prime member, I was able to buy the Fire TV Stick for 19 during a two day sale. I figured, for that price, I might as well test it out!Set up was easy and straight forward. I find that the interface is quick and easy to use. The interface and streaming on the Stick is much faster than the Amazon app built into my HDTV. This fact alone made this a great purchase. Here are some more thoughts I have on the Fire TV Stick so far: PROS:- Quick, easy to use, polished interface- Wireless streaming works really well- Amazon Instant video loads, fast forwards, and rewinds really fast- A dedicated Prime Menu allows Prime members to easily see what free content is available- Unlike Chromecast, the Fire TV Stick includes a remote- Can stream your own videos by first uploading them to your cloud disk- Can play quite a few casual games- Awesome, irresistible price for Amazon Prime users. I got it for 19 during the two day sale.- Better specs than Chromecast and Roku Stick- Ultraportable. I plan to use Fire TV Stick when I travel for work and to visit family- Stream local videos and other content using the Plex app http://www.amazon.com/Plex-Inc/dp/B004Y1WCDE/ (Thanks BikeRider!) CONS:- Included remote doesn't support voice search. That remote costs extra. Would be nice to have a second Fire TV Stick model that includes the voice search remote, rather can requiring us to buy a second remote.- Probably won't be able to use universal remotes with this unless Logitech offers a compatible device.- Not as fast as Fire TV, but since the Stick is so much cheaper, this is not really an issue.Read more",5,positive,fortunate order one soon announced amazon prime member able buy fire tv stick two day sale figured price might well test outset easy straight forward find interface quick easy use interface streaming stick much faster amazon app built hdtv fact alone made great purchase thought fire tv stick far pro quick easy use polished interface wireless streaming work really well amazon instant video load fast forward rewinds really fast dedicated prime menu allows prime member easily see free content available unlike chromecast fire tv stick includes remote stream video first uploading cloud disk play quite casual game awesome irresistible price amazon prime user got two day sale better spec chromecast roku stick ultraportable plan use fire tv stick travel work visit family stream local video content using plex app httpwwwamazoncomplexincdpbywcde thanks bikerider con included remote doesnt support voice search remote cost extra would nice second fire tv stick model includes voice search remote rather requiring u buy second remote probably wont able use universal remote unless logitech offer compatible device fast fire tv since stick much cheaper really issueread,"['price', 'support']"
"Since the Fire TV stick was announced, I've heard a lot of people wonder if it was something worth picking up, essentially asking what does this thing do that my TV doesn't do already The answer is going to be different for different people, but here's an easy way to think about it Amazon Fire TV Stick is an excellent purchase if:-Your TV is not a smart TV. Meaning your TV or dvd player did not come pre-loaded with apps such as Netflix, Youtube, Pandora etc...-Your TV is a smart TV, but apps do not perform well. Some smart TVs have painful performance when streaming video, apps can be difficult to update, wifi connection can be spotty etc...-You want to access Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Pandora, and other such apps on your TV-You are an Amazon Prime Member and want to access your Prime Video, Prime Music, and Prime Photo accounts-You want to participate in casual gaming on your television.-You want to listen to music on your TV-You want to have portability. In other words, Television access to the above services while you are travelling. (Amazon says the capability to use in hotels/dorms etc... with shared wifi that requires frequent password entry is coming soon)So, the bottom line is that the Fire TV Stick allows you to access your movies, music and photos as well as games and more via your television. If your TV already does these things well, or you're already doing them via other devices such as a game console, then this may not be worth your while.So, how easy is it to use I'm telling you, you do not have to have an ounce of technological know how to have this thing up and running in a matter of minutes.Read more",5,positive,since fire tv stick announced ive heard lot people wonder something worth picking essentially asking thing tv doesnt already answer going different different people here easy way think amazon fire tv stick excellent purchase ifyour tv smart tv meaning tv dvd player come preloaded apps netflix youtube pandora etcyour tv smart tv apps perform well smart tv painful performance streaming video apps difficult update wifi connection spotty etcyou want access youtube netflix amazon prime pandora apps tvyou amazon prime member want access prime video prime music prime photo accountsyou want participate casual gaming televisionyou want listen music tvyou want portability word television access service travelling amazon say capability use hotelsdorms etc shared wifi requires frequent password entry coming soonso bottom line fire tv stick allows access movie music photo well game via television tv already thing well youre already via device game console may worth whileso easy use im telling ounce technological know thing running matter minutesread,['performance']
"UPDATE! 11/11/15: More than a year now of using the stick literally every single evening for netflix, and it has been overall very reliable.Bottom line This is the best streaming device for the dollar(In my humble opinion) It's cheap, it handles netflix/prime/hboGo/plex/games/a lot more doesn't seem much slower than the full firetv box. I started with a Roku2 in the living room which got pushed to the bedroom when i got the firetv box, then the firetv stick replaced the roku2. I tried the roku stick but returned it because it was just too darn slow. I'm completely firetv now and 100 happy with it..What it does: It adds internet/streaming functionality to any tv/monitor with an HDMI port. You can use any of the thousands of paid and/or free apps such as netflix, amazon prime, hulu, plex, news, digital fireplace, etc... There's a ton you can do. With some extra effort you can sideload things like Kodi and 3rd party apps. It's super simple to use, and the image quality can be great if your internet connection is fast.The Good stuff...-Same pricerange as the less capable/less powered Chromecast Roku stick-More ram/memory than the competition(keeps things running smooth)-More storage space than the competition, you can store more apps/games/etc..-You can do some gaming with it, but the firetv box is better suited-So small you can bring it pretty much anywhere with ease.-Simple clean interface.-Lots of games/apps to choose from-The phone app is actually pretty usefulNot as good stuff...-No connections other than usb for power, if you need ethernet/audio in/out, get the box!Read more",5,positive,update year using stick literally every single evening netflix overall reliablebottom line best streaming device dollarin humble opinion cheap handle netflixprimehbogoplexgamesa lot doesnt seem much slower full firetv box started roku living room got pushed bedroom got firetv box firetv stick replaced roku tried roku stick returned darn slow im completely firetv happy itwhat add internetstreaming functionality tvmonitor hdmi port use thousand paid andor free apps netflix amazon prime hulu plex news digital fireplace etc there ton extra effort sideload thing like kodi rd party apps super simple use image quality great internet connection fastthe good stuffsame pricerange less capableless powered chromecast roku stickmore rammemory competitionkeeps thing running smoothmore storage space competition store appsgamesetcyou gaming firetv box better suitedso small bring pretty much anywhere easesimple clean interfacelots gamesapps choose fromthe phone app actually pretty usefulnot good stuffno connection usb power need ethernetaudio inout get boxread,['quality']
"I initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing: the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.Fortunately, I had friends who owned each, so I ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis: both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment).It's been a week and I am loving my paperwhite, no regrets! The touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and I keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. (In any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading).Also glad that I went for the international shipping option with Amazon. Extra expense, but delivery was on time, with tracking, and I didnt need to worry about customs, which I may have if I used a third party shipping service.",5,positive,initially trouble deciding paperwhite voyage review less said thing paperwhite great spending money go voyagefortunately friend owned ended buying paperwhite basis model ppi dollar jump turn pricey voyage page press isnt always sensitive fine specific setting dont need auto light adjustmentits week loving paperwhite regret touch screen receptive easy use keep light specific setting regardless time day case hard change setting either youll changing light level certain time day every readingalso glad went international shipping option amazon extra expense delivery time tracking didnt need worry custom may used third party shipping service,['delivery']
"Allow me to preface this with a little history. I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.",5,positive,allow preface little history casual reader owned nook simple touch ive read harry potter series girl dragon tattoo series brave new world key title fair say nook get much use many others may gotten theirsfast forward today full week new kindle paperwhite admit im love kindle reading let relate review love reading back kindle investment experience receive buy kindle simply paying screen entire experience included buying amazoni reading hunger game trilogy shall moving onto divergent series soon thing nook hindered past year never inspired pick get hand dive never feeling oh man reading thing awesome however paperwhite feeling desire back simply adore kindle considering purchasing one stop thinking simply go full week downloaded book ton reading still half battery left wellmake happy inspire reader inside,['battery']
"I have to say upfront - I don't like coroporate, hermetically closed stuff like anything by Apple or in this case, Amazon. I like having devices on which I can put anything I want and use it. But...I was a fairly happy user of a Nook Touch for several years, but couldn't use all its functionalities since I live in Serbia. Then I lost the Nook and since no other devices can actually be fully used in Serbia (buying books with them, using their online capabilities) except the Kindle, and since no one except Amazon ships to Serbia, and since I've actually been a happy Amazon customer since 2005 over friends' accounts and since 2007 through my own, and since the Kindle definitely has the best technology - why not buy itSo I did. What I read in many reviews about the screen/light of the Paperwhite and similar devices was no problem with mine. The light disperses just fine, except a few black blotches (maybe you can see it in the picture) at the bottom of the screen, which are actually shadows of the black plastic casing and thus can't really be avoided. As you can see in the picture without the light - there are no blotches with light out.The Paperwhite's screen is just marvelous at 300 ppi, the touchscreen works just fine, the store works here in Serbia, and in these two days I've been using it, I'm a happy guy.I had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded books behave at least almost like Amazon books, but that's fine. That's the one thing I'd like to see Amazon do in some future upgrades: make the Kindle treat sideloaded books just like the ones bought from them directly, with sharing funcion (quotes and Goodreads) enabled and so on.The size is perfect, it sits very well in the hand, the light doesn't hurt the eyes in the dark (like the light on a tab does)... the packaging was fine, no problems there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life.So far, I can only recommend it.",5,positive,say upfront dont like coroporate hermetically closed stuff like anything apple case amazon like device put anything want use buti fairly happy user nook touch several year couldnt use functionality since live serbia lost nook since device actually fully used serbia buying book using online capability except kindle since one except amazon ship serbia since ive actually happy amazon customer since friend account since since kindle definitely best technology buy itso read many review screenlight paperwhite similar device problem mine light disperses fine except black blotch maybe see picture bottom screen actually shadow black plastic casing thus cant really avoided see picture without light blotch light outthe paperwhites screen marvelous ppi touchscreen work fine store work serbia two day ive using im happy guyi get hang make sideloaded book behave least almost like amazon book thats fine thats one thing id like see amazon future upgrade make kindle treat sideloaded book like one bought directly sharing funcion quote goodreads enabled onthe size perfect sits well hand light doesnt hurt eye dark like light tab packaging fine problem remains seen battery lifeso far recommend,"['packaging', 'battery']"
"This is a review of the Kindle Paperwhite launched July 2015. Essentially. the same as the previous Kindle Paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded (300 dpi) screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device. This review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other Kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you.Before I start, Ive noticed several complains about Kindle not supporting the ePub format used by Canadian public libraries. Dont be put off, theres a solution in the Frequently Asked Questions section below.This review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits. If youre in a hurry Ive included a summary at the start, and a Frequently Asked Questions section at the end.Summary - What can you do with it-----------------------------------------* Read a book. It can store 1,000s of books - take an entire library away with you on holiday.* Buy a book. You can browse the Amazon kindle store, and buy books over a WIFI connection* Borrow a book. Using the Kindle Owners Library you can borrow one of 60,000 books (if you have Amazon Prime Membership)* Share your books. Using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family* Highlight a section. Using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines. If several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated.* Record a bookmark. To come back to it later* Read a book on your Kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position* Look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder* Track a characters appearance throughout a book using the X Ray feature.* Read for weeks without needing to recharge - typically 4-6 weeks* Share you books (Multiple Kindles on the same account, or family sharing)* Access every book you've ever owned on the cloud - available for download within seconds over WIFI or 3G..What Devices are available--------------------------------As of July 2015, Amazon have the following Kindle devices on sale:-1. Kindle 6 (around CDN 79)2. Kindle Paperwhite 6th Generation (212 dpi - launched October 2013) - around CDN 1292. New Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen (300 dpi - launched July 2015) - around CDN 139-2093. Kindle Voyger - around US 219-289 (Doesnt seem to be on sale in Amazon Canada)4. Kindle Fire - 6 or 7 colour tablet computers at around CDN 300-400So you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options. Which to buy Here's a quick summary in order of cost.*** The entry level Kindle ***An entry level black and white (e-ink) book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks.A terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender. For the technically minded, it has a 1Ghz processor and 4Gb of memory with an E-ink display. Essentially this means it's (a) Black and White (b) Fantastic to read even in bright sunlight (c) Requires very little power - hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours.*** New Kindle Paperwhite ***Launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a super-sharp display with 300 pixels per inch - the same as the top of the range Voyage. The high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the original Paperwhite to 6 weeks - but still a very long time.Compared to the existing (2013) Paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and slicker than before, and a new Bookerly font plus better presentation of fonts on screen.If you have an existing Paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading. However, if you own a prior device, youll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance.*** The Voyage ***Far more expensive that Paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter. It has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e-reader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges. The back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new Page Press buttons on the side to turn the pages. When the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback (nice touch). It has 4Gb of storage (same as the Paperwhite), and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge.Although it has the same sharp (300 dpi) screen as the Paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions. This means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright. In addition, youll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness. To compensate, the Voyage automatically softens the light slightly. A lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device.*** Kindle Fire Tablet Computer ***The Kindle Fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the Kindle range. Similar to the Apple iPad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life - hours rather than weeks. Although you can read books on a Fire using the Amazon Kindle App, youll find the Kindle with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book. Youll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading eMails, the Kindle is a dedicated book reader device.Unlike a Kindle, the Fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep. The Paperwhite and Voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back-light which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it wont for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark.Finally, unlike the rest of the Kindle range, the Fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use, its less useful on holiday. The Kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight.What other options do I have----------------------------------Having decided upon the model (Kindle, Paperwhite, Voyage or Fire), the next decision is around:-* Special Offers - ie. adverts* 3G or WIFI connectionPersonally I have no issue with adverts on a Kindle. They only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting.The 3G option is a more difficult question. This effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books over-the-air instead of at home or near a WIFI hotspot. Personally I went for the WIFI model as the saving is considerable, but its a personal choice. Of course if you wont have WIFI at home, then youll need the 3G option.One point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a Personal Hotspot or local WIFI signal that your Kindle (or indeed any other WIFI device) can connect to. Got to Settings Personal Hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your WIFI only Kindle while youre out and about.Conclusion-------------If you love books but your on a budget, the original Kindle with WIFI and special offers is a great option. Youll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but youll lose out on the soft white back-light and super crisp display of the Papwerwhite.The Kindle Paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi super-sharp screen. Finally, theres the top of the range Voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness.If youre in the market for a Tablet Computer then the Kindle Fire range is worth considering, but youll get a better book reading experience on the Kindle. Myself I have both a Paperwhite and an iPad Air 2. I was skeptical at first, but the Kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand (on the train), and the back-light and long battery life a huge bonus.Frequently Asked Questions---------------------------------Q: What file format will a Kindle readA: Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively in addition to HTML, DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversionQ: What It doesnt support EPUB formatA: No - but you can convert your EPUB books using a freely available program called Calibre. Simple search for You Tube um0teoAR6zw and youll see a video explaining how to do this. Simples.Q: If I lose my Kindle, do I lose my books as wellA: No. All books are available on your Amazon account to download on a new device.Q: Can I save my place in the bookA: Yes. It will automatically save your place, and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position.Q: I often need reading glasses - can I adjust the font sizeA: Yes. Theres a range of fonts, and sizes to suit all tastesQ: Can I share books with my partner or childrenA: Yes. You can now share your books using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire familyQ. Can I use a Kindle to read in bedA. Yes. But only on the Paperwhite and Voyage models. Its a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light. For the base Kindle model youll need the light onQ. Are there any free books availableA. Yes! Over 40,000 classic titles are available for free (out of copyright), and they can be legally downloaded. If you have a Amazon Prime membership you can also borrow a book from the Kindle Owners Library which includes around 60,000 books.Q: How long does the battery lastA: Depending upon model, you should get between 4 and 6 weeks between charges on around 30 minutes of reading per day. Ive certainly found Ive gone for weeks without charging the deviceQ: How long does it take to chargeA: From absolutely flat, around 4 hoursQ: How many books will the Kindle holdA: Literally thousands. You can also download every book youve ever owned from your Amazon account - so the list is quite literally unlimited.Q: Do I need anything elseA: Youll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a USB socket as the Kindle range doesnt come with a charger (but the Fire does). Amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it. Some people also buy a cover, but I think this is not really needed. It adds to the weight, and is not really needed. It will protect your Kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag.",5,positive,review kindle paperwhite launched july essentially previous kindle paperwhite

"Purchased this as an upgrade to the first generation Kindle Paperwhite. The backlight is greatly improved, the display is of a higher quality, the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker  opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier.The one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation Paperwhite is the way it's manufactured  when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see a small section of the display covered in the e-ink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen. At first I thought this was a manufacturing defect, so I took it back to Best Buy and exchanged it for the same model, only to find that the second model had the same issue, except more-visible.This appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process. When the Paperwhite first came out, it was the crown jewel of Amazon's e-reader line, and Amazon was careful to precision-craft the devices. Now, that honor falls to the more-expensive Voyage, with the Paperwhite becoming the flagship, but still cheaper, option in the Kindle lineup, meaning the manufacturing quality of the Paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the Voyage.This won't be a huge annoyance for some people.

It took a bit for me to get used to the Kindle as I was used to reading the books on my phone with the Kindle app. I was a bit bummed with losing the color. I also dont like that it has no sound.

Raise, lower thermostat. It all works very well. If you don't need audio quality, use DOTs. Echo is overkill for my use when DOTs are just as capable. With 6 DOT, 1 Echo and smart 42 devices connected, the home is very smart. Echo and DOTs make it happen. I still use Echo in one location since it was the first part of the system I bought. But now realize DOT would have been fine in that location as well.

"When I made this purchase, it was for what I thought was a nice little gadget that would allow me to listen to Amazon Unlimited Music. I plugged it in and the setup was a breeze. I was able to get the Amazon Unlimited Music at a great price (only $3.99/mo if used only on an Echo product), and the quality amazed me.Then, I was in another room and decided to see how far this could pick up my voice commands...and spoke, loudly, a command to play music from one of my playlists, and the Amazon Echo actually heard me correctly...from three rooms away!So I started checking this item out a bit more. It now turns on my TV (I already had a Harmony hub), can use it to change channels, turn on Roku, etc. With just a few other smart home gadgets, this Amazon Echo can turn lights off and on all by voice commands. It can control a thermostat, turn on a coffee pot. The possibilities seem endless. When I purchased this Echo I had no idea it did so much. You know what else it can do? It can order items through Amazon by voice, add reminders to my calendar, make a shopping list for later use and even help me tune my guitar! If you have a large home, you can pick up an Amazon Dot, which allows you to access your smart home devices when the Amazon Echo is at the other end of the house. Forget to turn off the living room TV and you're already snug in your bed? Amazon Echo can remedy that with a single command if you use the Harmony hub. Want to set an early morning alarm? Just ask the Amazon Echo to do so and let it wake you to the sound of your choice. Having trouble falling asleep? Ask Amazon Echo or Dot to read one of your Kindle E-books or play some relaxing music.

Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Best Buy had them on sale so it was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them ""echolettes"" LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them.

As for what Alexa can and can't do...that is tough to say since we don't have any smart devices in the house at that moment. It works well for quick weather, news and traffic reports but not so good for a free-form question. Google was more intuitive and better at understanding the question.

We have been Amazon Prime members for many years and this is a logical extension of the Amazon ecosystem. I think most folks who use Prime will be pleasantly surprised by what it can do.

"My primary reason for purchasing this was to control my new smart home devices. In particular, our Phillips Hue lights.

Also, making lists is JUST a shopping list. It would be great if I could add to an Amazon wish list instead! Seems like a natural!? Great for checking weather, sports and such. Playing music is hit or miss with my Prime account... to REALLy get everything, you apparently have to have the monthly fee enabled ""unlimited"" feature. Example: I can listen to the Police or Foo Fighters, but no Led Zeppelin - really??? Then it just tries to ""sell you"" the upgrade when you ask it to play something it can't. That's pretty annoying.

"Having realistic expectations is a must with the Echo. I had thought the AI would be much better than it is. Sometimes you need to say something three times for Alexa to find it. For example if you ask her to play a specific song by a specific artist the first two times she will say there is no song by that particular artist but on the third attempt she finds it. This is with voice training complete mind you. I purchased three echos to use as a starter system to play music on each floor of my house. They did not support whole house play at first but due to high demand they now have a group setting so you can play music simultaneously on all your echos. Be warned though if you ask Alexa to play your group (multiple echos) you cannot play all your devises at once using Spotify for example. Verbally asking Alexa to play the entire group only allows play from amazon music. The Alexa app needs some work but is fairly easy to navigate. I feel Im pretty tech savvy so for those who arent just take some time to browse through the app on your phone. You need to enable skills in order to get responses to certain questions which to me is a big draw back. I think most have the intention of buying the Echo, setting it up, and asking it anything and getting a response without all the extra setup. Remembering specific phrases to get an exact response can be a bit of a hassle. I gave it four stars because it works for playing most music through my whole house without breaking the bank. I think there is still a lot of improvements that could be made and it seems Amazons priority isnt necessarily the Echo. From reviews Ive read the request to play music on multiple devices was something people were asking for since the products release. I was able to pick them up when they were in sale but to be honest if I would have paid full price I would have returned all three and saved my money. Wait until they go on sale and then you can justify some of the shortfalls of the product.",4,positive,realistic expectation must echo thought ai would much better sometimes need say something three time alexa find example ask play specific song specific artist first two time say song particular artist third attempt find voice training complete mind purchased three echo use starter system play music floor house support whole house play first due high demand group setting play music simultaneously echo warned though ask alexa play group multiple echo cannot play devise using spotify example verbally asking alexa play entire group allows play amazon music alexa app need work fairly easy navigate feel im pretty tech savvy arent take time browse app phone need enable skill order get response certain question big draw back think intention buying echo setting asking anything getting response without extra setup remembering specific phrase get exact response bit hassle gave four star work playing music whole house without breaking bank think still lot improvement could made seems amazon priority isnt necessarily echo review ive read request play music multiple device something people asking since product release able pick sale honest would paid full price would returned three saved money wait go sale justify shortfall product,"['price', 'support']"

"I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request. Even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone, tablets and watches that can control devices, its HUGE to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion.I am a regular Amazon Prime shopper and reviewer, if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the Echo, please mark the Helpful button, it tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this.

"My second Alexa (I refuse to call it echo). This little toy wakes me up every morning and together with her little sister help me avoid burning my food, stay up to date with news, play my favorite music, control Hue Lights, remember things, and read. I slowly grew attached to Alexa and now it's a part of my life that I probably cannot live without. The one thing that I don't do with it is shopping (sorry Amazon) and I shop a lot. I find it cumbersome and unintuitive. Perhaps you can use it to reorder things that you are already familiar with. The sound quality is good enough. Every morning Alexa plays some upbeat music to jump start my day. It's not as good as my UE Megaboom; it lacks bass.

"Your mileage may vary, but... I picked up both the Google Home and the Amazon Echo because I wanted to see which one was best.

For playing podcasts, Echo is on top of it. For answering questions, Google Home allows me to get to my answer a lot faster with better sources. In terms of audio quality, Echo is top dog. Can it hear you from across the room? Yeah, in fact - mine can hear me from outside my office 3 rooms away.Has it changed my routines? Yep. I love the Flash Briefing.

The Dot was an option, but the sound quality isn't good enough for me while the Echo is (I'm not a huge music aficionado, just like clear music) and it doesn't require me to keep an extra set of speaker or use up computer resources to stream.

"As a Google Home user I was excited to try its direct competitor, Amazon Echo, since a lot of people that I know have an Echo and are enjoying theirs so far. The setup process is very simple and requires you to download Alexa App for your mobile device. The Alexa App definitely needs more improvement as I found myself having to relaunch the app at times to reconnect the Echo to my wireless network. Alexa has bluetooth connectivity which is great for streaming music from my iPhone, something Google Home does not have currently. The mic is very sensitive which I like so I don't have to speak too loudly to wake the Echo up and it picks up voice from the far end of the living room; the Echo is located in the dining room. Sound quality is pretty good and music did not have too much distortion at higher volumes.The Echo's is more on the heavier side which I like cause I feel the build quality is good. The Echo is tall so the tall black cylinder stands out in my dining room table. I like the 360 speaker and mic design. Volume control can be adjusted by twisting the top upper ring which is simple enough. Amazon Echo uses Bing for querying answers to your questions and this is definitely where I think Echo takes a hit. There were quite a few simple questions I asked Echo that Google Home had no problem answering. Google search is the best, bar none.One of the bonuses of Amazon Echo is surely felt if you are a Amazon Prime member. For example, I asked Echo to check my order status for items I ordered on Amazon and it told me I had items out for delivery today. Also you can ask Echo what are today's deals on Amazon and it asks whether you want to buy the item it mentions. There is a lot of potential and more benefits for Amazon Prime customers.Overall I really enjoyed using the Amazon Echo and I am impressed with the design and build quality. Amazon's usage of Bing for searching is definitely lacking compared to Google. This is a solid complimentary assistant for Amazon Prime Members. Bluetooth is a plus for sure.PROS: Solid build and design quality. Good audio quality. Sensitive mic. Perfect for Amazon Prime Subscribers.CONS: Amazon Bing search is not nearly as good as Google.

"I've been considering the whole ""smart home"" phenomenon for a while. Even though I love tech in general, this particular aspect didn't seem to have much appeal for me personally. My impression was that it hadn't quite arrived yet. Then some friends got the Echo along with the Hue lighting system and the Nest thermostat. When I saw how well it all integrated and just how cool it is, I was intrigued. That was enough for me to take the plunge. Now I have all three and I love how they all work together. Alexa is at the heart of it with many handy features. She can give me weather, traffic and news. She can turn on or turn off my lights and adjust the heat. She can set a timer when I'm cooking. She can check my Google calendar to remind me of appointments and birthdays. She can answer many (but certainly not all) of my random trivia questions. Some of her responses are funny and cute Easter eggs. Her built-in shopping and to-do lists are rather basic, so I haven't found much use for them yet. She processes my requests, with only the occasional misunderstanding. Her microphones are sensitive enough to hear me in the living room from the top of the stairs in my townhome (although I did get the optional remote for the bedroom). Only sometimes do I have to repeat myself if I don't speak clearly enough or my phrasing is awkward. Amazingly, she knows to control the correct fixture when, for example, I accidentally say ""table lamp"" instead of ""table light,"" as the bulb is actually labeled in the system. The setup was quick and easy, both for the Echo itself and the integration with the Nest and the Hue bridge. The app is easy to use, with only one minor issue (see below).Her internal speakers aren't spectacular, but they're acceptable for background music while doing chores or puttering around the house. Using the app to establish a connection to the Bluetooth adapter for my old stereo system wasn't particularly intuitive, but following the instructions posted on the Amazon web site got it done. Now I can stream music through the Echo itself or through my stereo for better quality, depending on my mood. You can integrate services like Pandora and Spotify, but I just use Amazon Prime Music, since I already subscribe to it.Naysayers will rightly point out that you can do all of the above things with other simpler devices, and of course, they're right. The Echo is certainly a luxury, a toy even, but it is fun and useful for me. In my experience and for my purposes, it works well with only minor limitations. It met and exceeded my expectations.

It would be better if you could connect it to a good quality stereo receiver that enable blue tooth. The dot can be connect to blue tooth speakers or blue tooth capable audio receivers. The Dot does have a small speaker in it so if it is not connected you can still use it. The problem with the dot is if you use the included 3.5 mm audio jack it disable the internal speaker. This means you have to have the audio component on to hear the Dot. However the blue tooth connection on the Dot works great. I own a Marantz AV receiver with blue tooth. I tell Alexa to connect and it automatically turns on the receiver, set it to the correct input and is ready to play music or any other audio I want to listen to through the Dot. When I tell Alexa to disconnect it turns of the receiver and switches back to the internal speaker.

When she does know a command for example like say ""Loop Mode"" when you want her to repeat a song... most of the time she understands that. And then there are a lot of times when she simply beeps out or even says she doesn't understand the question no matter how many times you say it. We use her mostly for a timer, alarm, play music and for 6 questions of Jeopardy a day. Really needs a lot of improvement. Ask her what a dog says.. she says bow wow or woof. *Sigh* If she can only be basic on that answer, there isn't much more she is gonna get right.

User is stuck in a do-loop with no response.2) access to quick 1-sentence read from Wikipedia is appreciated, but if you ask 'tell me more,' Alexa's voice is so rushed and computerized, some of the information is unintelligible.3) tons of skills, but so many of them are at a micro level and others are 1-time gimmicks. If you are not careful, you then need a skill to help you with all the skills you've installed.4) responses on some of the more interesting skills are just plain wrong. Vocabulary on word master is limited, so you will told your response is not a word that begins with ""X"" and we have had instances where our correct response on Jeopardy is reported as not correct. In one skill about a magic door (?) a clue is described, but when selected, you are sent backward a step with the same clue offered again. Frustrating and makes you feel you are doing something wrong or not speaking clearly. Children can get frustrated quickly.5) access to music is quirky.

"Let's be realistic on two fronts about the Echo: (1) I'ts fun to play with, a novel idea. (2) There are some serious flaws and if you doubt me you can try these yourself. Ask Alexa these three questions:(1) ""What is the Customer Service Number for UPS?"". You'll be told the phone number of your nearest UPS store. No matter how you phrase the question.(2) ""Alexa, what is the current humidity outside?"". You'll get the days weather report no matter how you pose the question. Seriously, it cannot even provide the Humidity?(3) ""Alexa, Who makes the 747 Jet?"". You'll hear ""Hmmm, I'm not sure what you meant by that question. So throw in a clue with ""Alexa, who makes the Boeing 747 Jet?"" and you'll hear the same answer. And this product is alleged to go out to the web to pull down information from Wikipedia, et al?(4) The reproduction of music is egregious at best. Read anywhere on the Internet and you'll see this mentioned time and time again. It's very, very bad.

"I love my Echo. My son had one since it first came out and frankly I was not that impressed and didn't think I would use it. I love technical stuff and when they had a good sale on them, I decided to try it and thought if I didn't like it, I could take it back. Well, was I surprised!!! Ahead of buying it, I had already set up more of my Amazon Prime music playlist, and the library too. Then I also went to Pandora and created more playlists and stations there. That saved a lot of time. Set up was so simple, no problems at all. I find I use the News Briefing every morning, what's on my calendar for the day or a specific day, and playing the music a lot whereas with my ipod, I usually don't unless we have company. Also, adding to shopping list and to my google calendar I use all the time. I would say the negatives are - if you have the volume up higher, she doesn't always hear you for the command. Another learning curve is the commands themselves. It is hard to remember exactly how she wants you to say the task. Right now I am writing down on index card the skills I can't seem to remember, such as Mindfullness from Prime which plays quiet meditation music or you have to tell her playlist from what location and between Amazon Prime and Pandora, if you don't say the exact playlist name that you made, she can't find it easily. Overall, just love it - I looked into buying the Echo Dot to place that in my bedroom, but was so disappointed that they have sold out and discontinued it. There is some hint that they are bringing something else out similar, but I liked the fact that it WAS a plug in, not internal battery that only lasts a few years. I wanted to be able to take it on vacation and pack in suitcase but the Tap has a charger unit with it, more bulky, & not excellent reviews, but the Dot had great reviews.",5,positive,love echo son one since first came frankly impressed didnt think would use love technical stuff good sale decided try thought didnt like could take back well surprised ahead buying already set amazon prime music playlist library also went pandora created playlist station saved lot time set simple problem find use news briefing every morning whats calendar day specific day playing music lot whereas ipod usually dont unless company also adding shopping list google calendar use time would say negative volume higher doesnt always hear command another learning curve command hard remember exactly want say task right writing index card skill cant seem remember mindfullness prime play quiet meditation music tell playlist location amazon prime pandora dont say exact playlist name made cant find easily overall love looked buying echo dot place bedroom disappointed sold discontinued hint bringing something else similar liked fact plug internal battery last year wanted able take vacation pack suitcase tap charger unit bulky excellent review dot great review,['battery']

"I am an Amazon fanboy. I'll say it right up front. This device, although nice, currently has limited functions, especially considering the $200 price tag. So until more useful functions (linking to Google Now for instance) are added, I can only give my Echo as much as it pains me to do so, an average rating. Nice to have if you have extra cash sitting around and you don't mind waiting so see if useful functions will be added, but without Android syncing and functions,or the ability to control for example,TV channels, it's far from Amazon's usual ""gotta have it right now!"" category.",3,neutral,amazon fanboy ill say right front device although nice currently limited function especially considering price tag useful function linking google instance added give echo much pain average rating nice extra cash sitting around dont mind waiting see useful function added without android syncing functionsor ability control exampletv channel far amazon usual gotta right category,['price']
"Amazon EchoPros:1.Amazing speakers and voice recognition. I can be 30 plus feet away and communicate with the Echo.2. Speaker system in the unit is much nicer then anticipated. I compare it with the UEBoom device.3. The Amazon Echo App is very easy to manage and add in different functions to access. So many different programed commands with the unit that you will not even know where to begin.4. The design of the unit is very nice. Solid from top to bottom. Quick summary of pros:If you are looking for a unit to respond quickly to the weather, playlists, talk radio, and reading of non-audio books back to you. You will love this unit. I was not a believer prior to purchasing the device. Alexa is much more then just a novelty. Cons:1. The amazon Echo is stationary. If you unplug the unit you have to take the cable with you to plug the unit in the new place. So if you want the unit on a deck or a back yard table make sure you have an extension cord or an outdoor plug.2. If you don't subscribe to Amazon Prime then half of the units greatest options are nonexistent. With Amazon prime you can establish or use preexisting playlist from the Amazon music store. Also, if you have books you have purchased through amazon kindle app you can pull up those books on the Echo and have them played back to you. You can use Spotify as a secondary option but it require addition work on your part to set up playlists.3. The voice commands are clumsy. What I mean by this is; you have to ask the question exactly like it says in the echo app. Some examples are, ""Alexa, What is the weather like in Manchester England?"", ""Alexa, ask PGA tour for the round leader."", or ""Alexa play the best of the 90's play list from Amazon Music?"". If you miss the ask blank. She will come back with I don't understand the question. Cons summary:These may not seem to be a big deal but not having prime or not remembering the commands exactly will limit the Echo's capacity. The unit is meant to simply your life not make if more difficult for you to remember robotic questions. Overall;If you have or plan to subscribe to Amazon Prime, then this unit will provide you with some very nice simple moments. My family does and the Echo is used everyday from playing music from amazon prime, to finding out the weather, to seeing if our commute to work has any traffic to worry about. If 179.99 is not a lot of money to you for a more hands free toy.

"This is my second Echo. The first one I purchased at Home Depot for 139. I knocked it off my nightstand a few times with no damage. The last time it fell, it completely died. So now it's just after Christmas and they are few and far between to purchase one. Amazon has a back order for almost a month for 179 and eBay tries to rape you with prices up to 300. I finally gave in and purchased one for 200. I love the Echo and all the accessories that you can purchase for it. BEWARE, buy a stand or wall mount for your Echo and protect your investment. My mistake the first time. If you have pets, you can count on it being knocked over. There are too many components inside the Echo to be abused.

"When I originally wrote this review this remote shipped with the Amazon Echo. Since that time Amazon has made it a separate purchase and dropped the retail price of the Echo by twenty bucks. I purchased my Echo via the Prime invitation for ninety-nine dollars, and at that time it came with this remote, but as stated - it's now only sold as a separate accessory and DOES NOT ship with the current Amazon Echo offered for sale on Amazon for one seventy-nine at the time of this review revision (12/6/15).-----------------------------------This is an excellent accessory for Amazon Echo owners, but please note you cannot pair more than 1 Amazon Echo remote with the Echo at one time.The remote comes with a magnetic cradle which is very handy for storage. (I have my Amazon Echo in my home office, and I store my remote on the magnetic holder which is attached to the side of a wire shelving unit. The remote will not just magnetically attach to metal devices without the holder however.------------------------------------------------What I have found is that using the remote becomes necessary in these scenarios:1. I'm in another room and I want to direct the Amazon Echo to change music or adjust the volume of music that's playing. (Change album, forward to the next song, have the Echo start playing another Amazon playlist from Prime Music, etc...).2. I want to add something to my Shopping List or To Do list when I'm in another room. I pick up the remote and speak into it, having Alexa add those things which then become visible on my list on my smatphone using the Amazon Echo app.3. I want to know the weather before getting out of bed, but the Amazon Echo is in the other room and wouldn't be able to hear me ask.Read more",5,positive,originally wrote review remote shipped amazon echo since time amazon made separate purchase dropped retail price echo twenty buck purchased echo via prime invitation ninetynine dollar time came remote stated sold separate accessory ship current amazon echo offered sale amazon one seventynine time review revision excellent accessory amazon echo owner please note cannot pair amazon echo remote echo one timethe remote come magnetic cradle handy storage amazon echo home office store remote magnetic holder attached side wire shelving unit remote magnetically attach metal device without holder howeverwhat found using remote becomes necessary scenario im another room want direct amazon echo change music adjust volume music thats playing change album forward next song echo start playing another amazon playlist prime music etc want add something shopping list list im another room pick remote speak alexa add thing become visible list smatphone using amazon echo app want know weather getting bed amazon echo room wouldnt able hear askread,['price']
"This is a review for the echo itself since you can't leave a review for it yet. I received my echo March 24, 2015 and i love it! I requested an invitation for it back in the beginning of December 2014. I got an email from Amazon a month later offering me the option to purchase it in January. I am a prime member so I purchased it for 99 right after I got that email. It said it would be shipped out around the first week of April. However in March I received an email saying they were able to ship it out earlier and they did. So I waited 3 months from the time I requested it. I'm so glad I bought it back then because the price for prime members is now 149. Anyways I personally love the Echo. My 3 daughters love it more then I do. I have a 9, 6, and a 2.5 yr old and they all kno how to use it. My little one tries to say Alexa play Mimi (Minnie mouse) so she can hear the Mickey mouse clubhouse theme song. I primarily got this for my daughters. One of them is dyslexic and the other 2 are on the spectrum. So they need help with doing homework. Alexa comes in so handy for this especially with spelling. My dyslexic daughter mixes up letters so this feature helps her tremendously. Also being able to voice command Alexa to play a song at any time, really comes in handy when I'm trying to redirect my daughters, when they are having a melt down. My youngest is obsessed with Mickey so if I say Alexa play hot dog, my 2 yr old will freeze and change her focus to the music. So for these features make me happy! Also the music plays very clear and loud in my opinion. I didn't have any problems with the app until today. It did seem off today. However they are always updating things so I don't know if that's what caused it to be different.Read more",5,positive,review echo since cant leave review yet received echo march love requested invitation back beginning december got email amazon month later offering option purchase january prime member purchased right got email said would shipped around first week april however march received email saying able ship earlier waited month time requested im glad bought back price prime member anyways personally love echo daughter love yr old kno use little one try say alexa play mimi minnie mouse hear mickey mouse clubhouse theme song primarily got daughter one dyslexic spectrum need help homework alexa come handy especially spelling dyslexic daughter mix letter feature help tremendously also able voice command alexa play song time really come handy im trying redirect daughter melt youngest obsessed mickey say alexa play hot dog yr old freeze change focus music feature make happy also music play clear loud opinion didnt problem app today seem today however always updating thing dont know thats caused differentread,['price']

"I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request. Even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone, tablets and watches that can control devices, its HUGE to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion.I am a regular Amazon Prime shopper and reviewer, if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the Echo, please mark the ‘Helpful’ button, it tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this.

"As a standalone charger, this one does pretty good and I like the versatility to charge other items with the USB female plug vs. something hardwired that allows me to charge other USB-type devices in addition to something that uses a micro USB port.Charging time is faster for a Kindle Fire vs. my regular e-Ink Kindle charger, but since I haven't - and rarely - fully drain one of my Fires I cannot comment on the faster aspect for charging a Fire: I just know it works, and it does seem to charge my phone faster than the plug that came from Verizon. Thats not a shocker as this one is 9 watts vs. 5 for the normal charger.This is a replacement model to the original 9W PowerFast charger. Rather than the prior models square look this one is longer in a rectangular form and sticks out further from the socket. That seems to add more clutter to a wall socket. This years model also has rigid prongs (what you stick into the electrical socket) vs. the fold-down version of the prior model that gives it a lower profile. I didnt think too much of it at first, but the longer profile of the rectangular design, in addition to the electrical prongs not folding down into the charger, means it takes up a little bit more room in my laptop bag. Thats not good for me as now it wont fit in a side pocket for my brand of laptop bag and goes into the general pile of stuff that floats around in the main bag.19.99 seems to be a lot for an adapter of this power size, and it is: despite my comments on the changes above, the PowerFast chargers Amazon makes do seem to last.

"I had a tough time finding reviews for this version of the Tamron. Read several reviews comparing the Nikon and the Sigma equivalents to this lens' previous version. The main draw back for the original Tamron 600mm was some design issues like lack of weather proofing. All those seem to be addressed from what I can see and have read. I have not done a high end performance test with color charts dissecting every bit of pixel like some articles I read. I can say that it works very well and the detail I get with my D810 is incredible. I took the below shot at the zoo. The weight can be off putting to some people but that comes with the territory of any large lens and I don't see this one being anything out of the ordinary when it comes to weight.

"As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! BTW, I haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since I grew up in Texas and expected a problem with my accent. Obviously, this item is ideal for people who are Amazon Prime members, so you can stream Prime Music, although it also streams Pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to Amazon. I guess the most unique thing about the Tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control. I have paid more for smaller ""just"" bluetooth speakers, so to me, this was a super deal, and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment!",5,positive,bluetooth speaker tap rock sound quality excellent plenty loud needed excellent quality stutter streaming bought one instead echo portable lug room room charging stand convenient tap stay time press button activate voice command issue something consider want hand free use may want big brother echo device hand free tethered place power cord portable feel tap black fabric cover nice slip hand fabric like tough upholstery cover wont stain easy damage quite attractive glad bare plastic would easy drop found easy pair bluetooth wireless work advertised mostly use playing music asking alexa silly question fun occasionally use shopping list show phone checking weather know future holdswhen time sit really learn understand amazon plan add alexa skill time one got smart house control compatible product tap would eliminate remote already many think really fun cool item glad got much fun use voice command instead typing especially tiny smart phone typing could get used alexa app phone allows certain voice command show phone like shopping list list calendar tap also check traffic weather movie etc directly wi fi phone needed however alexa phone app actually help figure tap tap read audible kindle ebooks well btw havent problem understand amazing since grew texas expected problem accent obviously item ideal people amazon prime member stream prime music although also stream pandora music service many thing without connection amazon guess unique thing tap ability stream wi fi music directly without computer phone driving voice control paid smaller bluetooth speaker super deal continues source fun entertainment,['quality']

"IMPORTANT UPDATE (3/8/17): As you read my original review, please be aware that Amazon announced in early February (2017) a new firmware update that allows Amazon Tap owners to enable a hands-free option! By going into Settings in the Alexa app, you can now choose the hands-free option and have your Tap respond to voice commands without touching it, just like the Echo and Echo Dot! This is a fabulous development and something Tap owners have been hoping for. Thank you, Amazon!Since the lack of hands-free operation was the one major shortcoming of the Tap, this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better. One thing to keep in mind, though, especially if you use your Tap on battery power: The hands-free mode will drain the battery more quickly, because it requires the microphone to be on at all times. But since you can easily toggle between hands-free or regular tap mode using the Alexa app, you can pick and choose how you want to use your Tap for maximum battery life and convenience.-------------------------I admit that I was a little skeptical when Amazon first introduced its Echo device. But I decided to buy one anyway, thinking that if I didn't like it I could easily sell it. After all, back in the early days of the Echo it was in very high demand. So the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal. Today, as an avid music listener who loves to cook, I'm thrilled that I decided to give the Echo a try.I had wanted a device that I could stream music with in the kitchen, and the Echos hands-free voice control made it very appealing. But how would it sound That question was quickly answered as soon as I set up and started using my Echo.Read more",5,positive,important update read original review please aware amazon announced early february new firmware update allows amazon tap owner enable handsfree option going setting alexa app choose handsfree option tap respond voice command without touching like echo echo dot fabulous development something tap owner hoping thank amazonsince lack handsfree operation one major shortcoming tap wonderful little device gotten whole lot better one thing keep mind though especially use tap battery power handsfree mode drain battery quickly requires microphone time since easily toggle handsfree regular tap mode using alexa app pick choose want use tap maximum battery life conveniencei admit little skeptical amazon first introduced echo device decided buy one anyway thinking didnt like could easily sell back early day echo high demand financial risk associated trying minimal today avid music listener love cook im thrilled decided give echo tryi wanted device could stream music kitchen echo handsfree voice control made appealing would sound question quickly answered soon set started using echoread,['battery']

I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands.

"The Amazon Tap puts out an impressive amount of sound for such a small device. A few things to note if you're not familiar with the Tap or haven't seen it in person:- It's roughly the size of a glass of water- By default, you do have to press the microphone button to talk to Alexa, but as of an update released on Feb 17th, 2017 there is an option in the Alexa app to make the Tap always listen without pushing the button (at the expense of battery life)- The speaker grille is not metal, though it looks like it in pictures. It's a mesh fabric, similar to what you'd feel on the end of some speaker grilles and micrphones. It's firm and comfortable to hold, but if you push hard enough it does flex. - Using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock, as there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case.- You can charge the Tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro USB cable (one is included) into the back of the speaker.",5,positive,amazon tap put impressive amount sound small device thing note youre familiar tap havent seen person roughly size glass water default press microphone button talk alexa update released feb th option alexa app make tap always listen without pushing button expense battery life speaker grille metal though look like picture mesh fabric similar youd feel end speaker grille micrphones firm comfortable hold push hard enough flex using sling case likely allow use charging dock little room tap dock kind case charge tap using either included dock plugging micro usb cable one included back speaker,['battery']

I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap.

On the plus side, you don't have to say Alexa. On the negative side you still have to push the button. I understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if Alexa was listening all the time.

"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form.

"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly.

"The Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.It contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands. It also has Dolby stereo speakers for playing music. The Amazon Tap is basically the portable version of the popular Amazon Echo that was released last year.Ive been testing the Tap for several days now. Heres what I think so far: What I Like I find that the Tap understands my verbal commands accurately. This could be due to the fact that, since its button activated, Im always very close to the device when I speak to it. Nevertheless, its nice that Tap understands me the first time. This was my experience with the Amazon Echo as well.The audio is surprisingly good for such a small device. I test portable speakers all the time and Id say the Amazon Tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range. Don't expect Bose type sound or deep bass levels, however.No other portable speaker device offers voice control and Wi-Fi streaming. Thus the Amazon Tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers. This is especially true if you already have Amazon Prime and Prime Music.It supports many great services. Like the Amazon Echo that came before it, the Amazon Tap supports popular music services such as Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.Battery life has been good so far.

"This nifty little device is perfect for freeing yourself from the clutches of the evil and nefarious clutches of the dreaded cable empire. No longer will you be subjected to their random price raises of their already high prices. No more will you fret over paying exorbitant fees for channels that you don't even watch!! Yes this firestick can and will open up, quite literally an entire new world of viewing for you. Set up is simple and quick. There are a multitude of different apps that u can use to take complete control over what u want to watch and pay for. I'm not going to go into specifics about how to watch everything you want because we all have different interests. A simple google search will help guide you with those specifics. But just know that for financial freedom from contracts and corporate giants this is the way to go. One downside I will mention is the buffering. Ensure you have a good internet connection. This is a requirement for the device to work. Make sure u keep the device free of any unecessary apps which will take up its HD. Also ensure you have a router that is worth while. Personally I ended up going with the firebox instead of the stick because I wanted the best connection possible and as we all know that requires hard wiring of your device. So if u want to replace cable for your main living room tv area go with the box.

I love how this one lets you download apps. The picture quality is also a 4. I do find myself having to unplug it every 3 days to make it start over or it has trouble downloading. Especially with live tv apps. As for its competitors I'd say this is still the one to get. I find myself having a lot more options with this one. So my cons are minor. But still prevented me from a 5 star rating. I believe their next generation will be a 5 tho. Like I said. It's still the one with the most options available. Especially if you have prime. The best thing about Fire tv is it let's me download the direct tv app so I ditched my cable and just play live tv thru the app. It's the same tv and I pay over a $100 less a month now. It's worth it just for that.,4,positive,love one let download apps picture quality also find unplug every day make start trouble downloading especially live tv apps competitor id say still one get find lot option one con minor still prevented star rating believe next generation tho like said still one option available especially prime best thing fire tv let download direct tv app ditched cable play live tv thru app tv pay less month worth,['quality']

"I am very happy with this device. I've tried many different solutions to get to a good cord cutting setup and this is by far the best. From cheap Android sticks, to Roku, to Chromecast, to small form factor PCs, this is the best compromise between size, performance, and price. We use it primarily with PlayStation Vue but also with Amazon Prime. Interestingly enough it has become our preferred device for Netflix as well, even though Netflix is built-in to our Samsung TV. The Bluetooth remote is very good, even though the voice search/Alexa services are little more than a novelty. To be truly useful Amazon needs to open voice search to other apps. I'd love to be able to say ""watch CNN on PlayStation Vue"". My biggest knock however is the limited libray of apps. For example, there is a free CBS app for Android but the app for the FireTV requires a subscription. Yes, you can side load apps but that defeats the simplicity that makes this device great. Similarly, the lack of Google Play Movies and Google Play Music is regrettable.On a side note, if you don't plan to play demanding games, the new FireTV Stick (quad core) is just as competent a devices as this one, for less than half the price.

To me, I think FIOS is throttling HD contents.To sum it up, this is way better than the stick because of the hard-wiring capabilities.

The Fire TV itself is great for streaming various media over our wireless network to our TV in our sun room. At first we thought we'd have to get an extender but we got lucky and everything runs pretty smoothly. The applications are fast and responsive and the menus are easy enough to navigate for the young one in the house. The only thing we aren't happy with is that the remote chews through batteries pretty quickly. I have a Logitech Harmony remote that has a LCD screen on it and it doesn't go through batteries as fast the Fire TV remote. We now remove the batteries whenever the remote is not in operation. An annoyance but not a deal breaker.,4,positive,fire tv great streaming various medium wireless network tv sun room first thought wed get extender got lucky everything run pretty smoothly application fast responsive menu easy enough navigate young one house thing arent happy remote chew battery pretty quickly logitech harmony remote lcd screen doesnt go battery fast fire tv remote remove battery whenever remote operation annoyance deal breaker,['battery']

"As a video streaming device, the Fire TV is great, especially if you're a Prime member. It's more powerful than most media boxes on that market especially if you're into gaming, which is where that extra juice shines.In fact, tons of Android games play great on it. You don't even need the optional controller for most of them. And there's something to be said for playing Candy Crush on the big screen. But for more serious games like Grand Theft Auto, Tales from Borderlands, Modern Combat, or Knights of the Old Republic?Really well. You might want to invest in a controller for some of them (though not all game support the controller natively so do your research!) they run very smooth, and without any noticeable frame-rate drops. Though, most Android games don't really push the hardware anyway, so this should come as no surprise. But at the very least, this does mean you'll be able to play top-of-the-line Android games for several years with no problem. Some apps have their own versions specifically for the Fire TV, so you'll want to make sure to get those ones if available.You also may be wondering what the difference is between the 2015 model, and the previous 2014 launch model. Well...not much. The newer box is capable of a 4K output whereas the older version only went up to 1080p. But since most people don't even own 4K TVs, this feature probably won't be too useful. That said, it is nice future-proofing, as 4K TVs become more and more standard, the Fire TV will be ready. There are smaller changes here and there, but I'm not familiar enough with the older model to say what is what.Anyway, if you're looking for a streaming box that in addition to offering the usual Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and (of course) Amazon, also lets you play Android games (and play them well).It's worth noting that you can't access the Google Play store without rooting the system to install it first. Though, even then only a limited selection of Google Play apps is even compatible with the Fire TV (as of now) so it might not be worth the trouble, especially when Amazon usually offers comparable, if not the same exact apps anyhow. But it's worth pointing out all the same.",5,positive,video streaming device fire tv great especially youre prime member powerful medium box market especially youre gaming extra juice shinesin fact ton android game play great dont even need optional controller there something said playing candy crush big screen serious game like grand theft auto tale borderland modern combat knight old republicreally well might want invest controller though game support controller natively research run smooth without noticeable framerate drop though android game dont really push hardware anyway come surprise least mean youll able play topoftheline android game several year problem apps version specifically fire tv youll want make sure get one availableyou also may wondering difference model previous launch model wellnot much newer box capable k output whereas older version went p since people dont even k tv feature probably wont useful said nice futureproofing k tv become standard fire tv ready smaller change im familiar enough older model say whatanyway youre looking streaming box addition offering usual netflix youtube hulu course amazon also let play android game play wellits worth noting cant access google play store without rooting system install first though even limited selection google play apps even compatible fire tv might worth trouble especially amazon usually offer comparable exact apps anyhow worth pointing,['support']

"Pros:- Amazon Prime works on it.- You can still sideload apps, like Kodi.Cons:- Not a good upgrade over the original Fire TV, is worse in some aspects.- Remote buttons are hard to press (compared to original Fire TV)- Remote loses connection frequently and takes several button presses or removing of the remote batteries to fix- Interface isn't as snappy as the original Fire TV- Same interface as the original Fire TV: There's still no good way to sort your apps or locate the Prime content that you want.- Voice search seems about the same as the original Fire TV. Alexa adds nothing significant. You still can't use it to search in 3rd party apps, like Youtube.- As for video decoding in Kodi, performance isn't much better than the original Fire TV. You will be able to play HEVC content at 1080p with no problem, but 1080p .264 hi10p (software-decoded) does not play well. There's simply not enough power. 4k decoding is hit-and miss. It needs to be specifically coded for this Fire TV (low bitrate, low fps) to work properly.- Overall system performance is bad. When sitting idle, the CPUs spike up to 60% usage and memory is at 60% usage.

"It's somewhat of a step up from the Roku 3 I was previously using, but not as much as I was expecting. I think it's a couple firmware updates away from being better than it is now.Spent the good part of the day trying to figure out why I could only connect to my dual-band router at 2.4GHz and not 5GHz. 1.5 hours on the phone with Verizon FiOS tech support was unsuccessful as other devices connected at 5GHz without issue. Was about to pack it up and return it until I called Amazon tech support. Turns out it's a known-issue that the FireTV has difficulty with 5GHz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above 100.The tech support person said I should change the channel to 36, 44, or 48 instead of automatic, and, it worked.Bluetooth audio and video are out of sync with Showtime, Netflix, Sling, Plex and Hulu. It's fine through speakers, but video lags slightly behind the audio using Bluetooth. Audio and video are in perfect sync with Bluetooth and Amazon Prime Video which makes me think it'll be fixed at some point, as Amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regard.Gotta say I prefer the platform agnostic UI of Roku, with Amazon-world tucked away in an app. The FireTV navigation pane represents mostly Amazon products with no option to modify it. Roku's UI is more about the media, less about the provider. Voice search works well if you want only to be presented with Amazon's viewing options, for some reason I thought search was universal, but only movies and TV shows available through Amazon show up.

"This review is more of a guide for cablecutters, which we have found fire TV a great way to accomplish this. There's plenty of reviews explaining how to use the fire, so this is more for people like us who don't want to pay full cable prices but are ok with paying for access to apps to still watch all our cable shows, at a significant savings to cable, and are used to using a dvr (we used tivo) and don't want to watch commercials. We've had this box for a couple weeks now, and while it has taken some getting used to, since you have to access your shows through individual apps instead of them all being on one big list, we have found it worthwhile to make the switch.Keep in mind you have to be able to plug an hdmi cord into your tv. We actually had to buy a new tv to be able to use this box but tvs are so cheap nowadays that it was still cheaper to buy a new one than to keep up with our cable bill. The savings in just the first several of months covered the cost of the tv. The interface on the fire tv is really easy to use and navigate through all the apps you wish to use and everything is kept nice and organized. We got the box instead of the stick because we wanted to have a more reliable, faster wired connection to our internet. At first I was sad to read on other reviews that the voice control doesn't work on any of the apps, but honestly I've never even used it once since getting it and once you sign into everything, there's not much need of typing to find your shows on other apps so I really don't miss it at all. If you just want this to watch prime tv included in your amazon subscription then you can stop here, the rest is about what apps we use (and pay for) to watch our shows. I will list what apps we have found useful and what we found we could do without.Read more",5,positive,review guide cablecutters found fire tv great way accomplish there plenty review explaining use fire people like u dont want pay full cable price ok paying access apps still watch cable show significant saving cable used using dvr used tivo dont want watch commercial weve box couple week taken getting used since access show individual apps instead one big list found worthwhile make switchkeep mind able plug hdmi cord tv actually buy new tv able use box tv cheap nowadays still cheaper buy new one keep cable bill saving first several month covered cost tv interface fire tv really easy use navigate apps wish use everything kept nice organized got box instead stick wanted reliable faster wired connection internet first sad read review voice control doesnt work apps honestly ive never even used since getting sign everything there much need typing find show apps really dont miss want watch prime tv included amazon subscription stop rest apps use pay watch show list apps found useful found could withoutread,['price']
"As you've seen in other reviews, this can break your DX. But not if you put a little double-sided tape at each right side corner, ALWAYS move the elastic band so that it holds the right edge of the Kindle into the case against the tape, and never, NEVER swing the back open. If you let your Kindle DX swing freely back and forth the way the pages in a printed book do when you hold it by both the front and back covers, the plastic part of the case will break. So don't DO that! Note in other reviews that some people even without the tape have used this case for months with no cracking of the case. I have to assume those people always move the elastic band. They might also have been reading with the case flat on a table. But if you use the tape AND the band you can read in any normal position. Note that the DX weighs 19 oz and the case weighs 12 oz. For some people the DX without case MIGHT be suitable to hold in one hand. With the case, you read with this resting in your lap, or against your knees when you lie down, or on a table. The combo is as big and heavy as a college textbook. But you can tell this is an expensively made quality product.",5,positive,youve seen review break dx put little doublesided tape right side corner always move elastic band hold right edge kindle case tape never never swing back open let kindle dx swing freely back forth way page printed book hold front back cover plastic part case break dont note review people even without tape used case month cracking case assume people always move elastic band might also reading case flat table use tape band read normal position note dx weighs oz case weighs oz people dx without case might suitable hold one hand case read resting lap knee lie table combo big heavy college textbook tell expensively made quality product,['quality']
"My new Kindle DX2 graphite came yesterday and immediately I realized I needed a cover. I was nervous when putting the DX down and picking it up fearing that I would drop or scratch it and there's no great way to carry the Kindle around without a cover. Also I found the bare Kindle to be a bit fidgety to hold while reading and I was hoping a cover would give me a better grip.This cover was just released and I like the fact that it has the elastic band to hold it closed like the original Kindle 1, as I had read that the older DX cover did not always stay closed. I got the cover with 1-day local delivery and it just arrived.The cover weighs a bit more than 11 ounces so the Kindle with cover is 30 ounces. This makes it significantly heavier than just the Kindle alone (18.75 oz), however the cover gives you several better ways to hold the Kindle, including open like a book or folded back. If you rest the Kindle on something to take the weight off, it is definitely more comfortable to read with it. My preference is to lie on the couch with the Kindle balanced on my chest/stomach and my left hand holding the top of the left part of the cover open at about 90 degrees.I'd give it 5 stars if it was lighter, but so far I really like it.",4,positive,new kindle dx graphite came yesterday immediately realized needed cover nervous putting dx picking fearing would drop scratch there great way carry kindle around without cover also found bare kindle bit fidgety hold reading hoping cover would give better gripthis cover released like fact elastic band hold closed like original kindle read older dx cover always stay closed got cover day local delivery arrivedthe cover weighs bit ounce kindle cover ounce make significantly heavier kindle alone oz however cover give several better way hold kindle including open like book folded back rest kindle something take weight definitely comfortable read preference lie couch kindle balanced cheststomach left hand holding top left part cover open degreesid give star lighter far really like,['delivery']
"This cover is made for the Kindle DX and fits it beautifully. The problem - and it's a big one - is if you accidentlly try to open the cover from the back (which is very easy to do) you can damage the Kindle without even realizing what's happened. My husband did this and cracked the Kindle frame within the first week of owning the device. Fortunately, only the frame was cracked and the Kindle still works. We cannot, however, remove the cover because of the way it hooks into the device, the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back cover. After the incident, we attempted to clip the back cover to the Kindle, but found this to be cumbersome and the clip would not stay in place. We are just extremely careful now, but the damage was done almost immediately. I hope this design flaw has been fixed.",1,negative,cover made kindle dx fit beautifully problem big one accidentlly try open cover back easy damage kindle without even realizing whats happened husband cracked kindle frame within first week owning device fortunately frame cracked kindle still work cannot however remove cover way hook device hook closure must bent accidental attempt open back cover incident attempted clip back cover kindle found cumbersome clip would stay place extremely careful damage done almost immediately hope design flaw fixed,['design']
"I, as well as other Kindle lovers, have noticed that although we have taken great care with the cover, it has warped and has bubbles and is not durable. Within 3 months, and I only started using the Kindle with the cover in the past 2 weeks, noticed the cover has become warped and bubbled under the leather. No idea what would cause this, I have taken great care not to put it near any source that would have done this damage, not sunlight, heat, moisture or anything. I will be requesting a replacement, but Kindle manufacturers of the cover need to do their homework and come up with a better product, especially for the price we paid.",1,negative,well kindle lover noticed although taken great care cover warped bubble durable within month started using kindle cover past week noticed cover become warped bubbled leather idea would cause taken great care put near source would done damage sunlight heat moisture anything requesting replacement kindle manufacturer cover need homework come better product especially price paid,['price']
"Having recently received a Kindle Fire HD as a gift, I knew that hooking it up to my computer to charge it daily was not going to be convenient. That's when I found this little jewel along with the Kindle Fire AC charger. And they both work like a DREAM!. My desk stays uncluttered and the cord allows me to keep the Kindle plugged in while I read in bed or listen to music. It's well worth the price for the convenience it provides!",5,positive,recently received kindle fire hd gift knew hooking computer charge daily going convenient thats found little jewel along kindle fire ac charger work like dream desk stay uncluttered cord allows keep kindle plugged read bed listen music well worth price convenience provides,['price']
"Amazon already includes this cable with the Kindle Fire 7, the Kindle Fire HD 7 and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It's also great to purchase as a back up for the office or to take with you on the go. For the peace of mind knowing Amazon designed this to work specifically with Kindle Fire, it's worth the price.The quality of this cable compared to the previous white USB cable is much better. This cable has a thicker jacket on the outside so hopefully overtime it will hold up much better. Data transfer speeds between the computer and the device are relatively quick. This cable is actually a bit shorter than the white cable even though both are supposed to be 5 ft. in length. Measuring both cables, the black cable is approx 5 ft. and the white cable is approx 5 ft. 9in. Overall, even though it is shorter, this cable is starting off to be a much better improvement than the previous white version of this cable.",4,positive,amazon already includes cable kindle fire kindle fire hd kindle fire hd also great purchase back office take go peace mind knowing amazon designed work specifically kindle fire worth pricethe quality cable compared previous white usb cable much better cable thicker jacket outside hopefully overtime hold much better data transfer speed computer device relatively quick cable actually bit shorter white cable even though supposed ft length measuring cable black cable approx ft white cable approx ft overall even though shorter cable starting much better improvement previous white version cable,['quality']

"So I was already not too pleased with Amazon's choice to only include an essentially useless charger when purchasing a kindle hd, and caved to ordering the fast charger so it would not take hours of non-use to recharge. For 20 you don't even get a full charger, just an adapter to put on to the cord they already gave you. Amazon please just charge the real price for the device instead of settling to slowly rip people off with essential accessories, this sort of thing cheapens your image and erodes loyalty.",1,negative,already pleased amazon choice include essentially useless charger purchasing kindle hd caved ordering fast charger would take hour nonuse recharge dont even get full charger adapter put cord already gave amazon please charge real price device instead settling slowly rip people essential accessory sort thing cheapens image erodes loyalty,['price']
"This is not appreciably faster than any other 1.8 or higher amp charger when used with my Kindle, Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD, various Android tablets, and other devices that have USB charging cables.It also blocks an adjacent outlet. Why didn't they put the plug on the short end like the original black-and-white Kindle chargerIt is an exceptionally good deal when purchased together with a Kindle Fire HD on promotion, but the regular price is not competitive for a supposedly premium charger.Additionally, it does not come with a cable, an omission that many people won't realize.**EDIT** I appreciate the many comments, but Amazon promotes this charger as something that charges faster than other chargers, but I haven't seen any such advantage. At promotional prices, it's a good deal, but not at almost twenty dollars. Otherwise, look elsewhere.**EDIT** When the review was written, the description of the item did not have this statement Optimized for Kindle tablets: PowerFast is a 9W charger and will charge your Kindle tablets faster than the white 5W Kindle charger will. That line was added a considerable amount of time after I wrote my review.",3,neutral,appreciably faster higher amp charger used kindle kindle fire kindle fire hd various android tablet device usb charging cablesit also block adjacent outlet didnt put plug short end like original blackandwhite kindle chargerit exceptionally good deal purchased together kindle fire hd promotion regular price competitive supposedly premium chargeradditionally come cable omission many people wont realizeedit appreciate many comment amazon promotes charger something charge faster charger havent seen advantage promotional price good deal almost twenty dollar otherwise look elsewhereedit review written description item statement optimized kindle tablet powerfast w charger charge kindle tablet faster white w kindle charger line added considerable amount time wrote review,['price']
